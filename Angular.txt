an employer in the market is willing to pay me a little bit more. I would like to have a conversation to see if you can’t match the offer. 

Mention that the offer is time sensitive and I am considering it as it is good. But you have build so much good relationship here at wesbank and I would like to stay and not go, I love my Job. Is there anything they can do on their side. ??

it is has been runing for 6 hours

Hi B 1853,1570
We are still in freeze but we do “negotiate” on business critical changes.
Can we please get this info “@Nortje, Elize (Wesbank Fleet) please advise on the business impact, on why should it be allowed to go in? or why it cannot wait?”.
@Mahlangu, Nkosinathi/@Sivate, Themba Can you please explain from a technical point what exactly will this change do. I know it is XML deployments BUT what else is it doing?

DESCRIPTION
Certrack upload file - if there are multiple deal numbers then the vehicles do not update with the certrack information ie. OPL plus Mm deal
The system must allow for both the MM and OPL deal to be updated with certrack information. Attached is a copy of the error report for these. It is important for this to be done as the number of deals with two contracts are increasing.

Hi Panday, Sharona are still experiencing this issue INC5805583 Data on Auto Card does not match that on Miles.
HI Mandla, I have even forgotten about this one!  I cannot pick up the detail when I try to check.  I know as the issues occur  someone is assigned  - Pieter to close them....


I was in a meeting with business

The issue here is that the TPSC ticket has both xml files and database script, only xml files were deployed
Hopefully makes sense
According to the list that Sibusiso sent the ticket is part of the deployment but only xml files were deployed but the database script were left out

The report is not pulling a duplicate 
invoices are already added as the early settlement discount 
they are having the same percentage and they are already 
saved on the database  for invoice and vat amount 

it is not a duplicate and there is nothing we can do
the system is working as designed because the amount column has different values 
How do you  know which amount  I must take and which one i must leave ,this is not a duplicate 
now 
you have already put in these amounts  and associated them with the invoice number  
when the remittance is pulling the invoice number , it needs to also display the settlement discount hence it pulled 
all of them because they are associated with that invoice number

there's already  costallocation  for this invoice number = 'TWD07S065830/TWJ05S067729/TWJ08S067363/TWJ14S078285/TWJ05Q020177/TWD07Q017876'

4523
can we pick it up in today's 10.30 session please. 
I checked all the invoice numbers that they say are duplicate and there's already  a cost allocation for the early settlemet discount(priceitemname) 
so when that invoice pulls , it needs to also to pull the discount(amount) and there is 6 different discount in total
if the discount were the same it was going to pull one record now because they are different discounts the system will 
pull of them 

it is because of cost allocation each and every invoice number has cost allocation of early payment discount, if there is more than one when they see that 
So what do I do now , do i tell the system to pick the largest value  or how do i do it 


The system knows the actual total here , it will never dupliacate that amount here , becuse it pulls that from a different column, it is like a calculation that was already done on a database so here it does not calculate based on 
what you have here , it just search the amount from the database 
the invoice total is showing fine, but somehow business insist that there is a duplicate and that is not the case is because of the early settlement discount

Hi @Boshoff, Martinus,

The FICS Transaction GL Export job ran successfully last night, however it completed running at 05:58 which is very long.

I’m not sure if it was because of the catchup run, but will monitor tonight.

Attached is the business motivation for the Change, only thing outstanding is the table requirement for capacity planning.


Agreed – this is an exercise to achieve least privilege access on the lookup tables which will speak to the stability item for roles and access. 

@Meyer, Sisanda please assist in getting the initial table sizes, as well as a view on how often these tables change and how many records and/ or whether it’s typically updates. This can be done by reviewing the historic changes that have been applied. 

@Steyn, Tanja, please could you assist with engaging the various business owners associated to each table to find out similarly, how often do the tables change, is it typically updates, or add and if additions, what number of records are we looking at?

Hi All

From a pure technical side this will help with the stability freeze as this would directly mitigated one of the concerns IF I understand the explanation correctly and also if this is completely integrated with the process for requesting and approving access.
W.r.t. capacity planning, I take it that this will be a fairly static tables and the initial size of the table will not change to much over time. Do you have a estimate of the initial size?

If all approvals and also the concern from Nicolene is mitigated why don’t we plan this for next weekend?

Hi Candice,

Table size, data is currently on Miles IT could just pull a current table from Miles to determine the size.
From my understanding most of them are Adhoc.  So difficult to quantify.


@Meyer, Sisanda please assist in getting the initial table sizes, as well as a view on how often these tables change and how many records and/ or whether it’s typically updates. This can be done by reviewing the historic changes that have been applied. 

@Steyn, Tanja, please could you assist with engaging the various business owners associated to each table to find out similarly, how often do the tables change, is it typically updates, or add and if additions, what number of records are we looking at?

a user is  UNABLE TO TERMinate a  VEHICLE 
The reason why the deal is giving an error when a user is trying to terminate is 
due to the fact that there are already invoiced items after the desired termination date of second of june.
the user was not aware that invoiced items already existed so when he tries to terminate a vehicle he gets an error 

to fix this issue I need to manually run a job called 
ReverseNPSContract on a parameter I will pass a deal id  then a user will be able to terminate a deal



Please note that the deals that have not been termed as yet are still billing our clients,
The outstanding disposals are funds that have not been invoiced and being the FYE, the funds will negatively affect our performance.




no impact on people working on the system

life cganging decision
it akes me want to question my faith,it make wantto give up
its sport I love to compete and I love to be the best in the world,just the best 
I think destiny is what we make of it, you have to have to vision and then if you follow that i think miracles  can happen, 
this is exactly what my life has been about , i saw the pick of education i climbed tha pick then i saw the other pick
edmin hallery mountain climber,mount everest
I am tired of the same old phases the same old things
stay hungry
no matter how many successes you have always hungty for something more
the wolf on the hill is not as hungry as the wolf climbing the hill
a lot of times people only pay attention to success but the reality of it is that besides all this great success and joy, it was a struggle
just because theres difficulty,just because theres an obstacle i dont care what it takes i eventually 
big, too big is not big enough

theres lot of things i have to learn i had obstacles to overcome including biggest obstacles when everyone says no it can't be done 
why dont u give up ,because my vision did not talk about giving up ,my vision is about climbing that mountain

if I can see it then it must be achievable
the only thing that no one can take fom you is your mind , your brain power,your will is much more nb than the body
be hungry for information
fantasy , have a vision and when u visualize something clearly u must believe 100% that u can get there 
wha is the new thing,new challenge, a new moutain to climb
read a lot
I got to get out of here no matter what it takes
make my vision to become a reality
what I learnt from... was how important family was 
winning means everything to me
andnow lets move on
go to america
saw myself as someone that couldn't be stoped 
I alone cannot accomplish anything I need help
attend business classes 
everytime I win anything I say to myself ok what is the next thing?if u always hungry you never really get satisfied
The education of body builder



you can make your visions not onlt tobecome a reality but go beyond your dreams
crisis is a terrible thing to waist
get in touch with your roots where you come from
want nothing to do with my past life
work your as off
whatever u do mandla be useful
I dont think I was raised in a raised /brouht up   in a right place,there was something off here
where ur talent lies,what re u good at
think and visualize
have a strong mind

"01/06/2023 14:56 testing in progress
Morning: Looked at INC4824892 today, reset is regenerating billing items (same thing that was done for Shoprite, reset billing items all the way back to migration date. Regenerate revision items.) Take contracts that all have the same start date, to test in QA. Will start doing this today.
25/05 Confirm feedback from Martinus
18/05 new requirements for Sofico potentially, business to try do something for Stowe
15/05 this morning with Martinus, he'll review the video and will pick up with Pran thereafter
11/05 SDI being followed up - need to close out ideally before bill run. Setup another session with  - focus is difference to other contracts, why on certain have this impact, do we reload the customer?
Jerryco - interest is calculated on NPS, this impacts the rental variation
08/05 Further unpacking needed to understand
These incidents closed, new INC4824892 - 
04/05 Stowe communciated that they need explanation before he pays. Session with Pran today to understand
Stowe - now to prove the variations
02/05 Affecting 4 customers e.g. Shoprite as well, Krone, Wacko. Stowe, it's only a few contracts and they are the only ones who want an answer. Seemsl ike it's linked to accessory modification."

Hey Mtombeni, Mandla, I'm looking for a report I drew in the Month of May after bill run. Just to check if the Billing End Date doesn't change on the new month. If this is the case then I won't log a ticket.


, how are you? I'm sorry to bug you this late bru. I have logged INC5510276 for the Billing End Date concern which I had raised with you earlier. Please also check with Jerryco as I remember him changing some code when we were working on the Shoprite fixes. I wonder if those code changes he did are related?
Thanks

Please advise?
Config was done on SOFICO environment and changed was promoted to non prod environment . Shadow maintenance was not  applied on non prod environment and config worked fine however on prod in was throwing invalid column error(activation type) 
We normally follow 2 deployment process 
1)	If a change includes database script ,copying files to miles query root folded , and restarting of miles system we present it at ecab
2)	If a change only includes importing xml files via MMC we normally don’t present changes at ecab, because we import these files almost everyday , the DI format that we normally use is Miles (XML imports) -day Month - Config Team we have created these  DI’s since 2021 for example FML-1911 Miles (XML imports) -07 Dec - Config Team 11 a similar process was followed

You need to “sell” your experience, qualifications and ability.
Every time you persuade your colleagues to use your solution to a business problem you
use your selling skills. All you need is a basic sales strategy that anyone can use.
It means that you must evaluate all of
your past responsibilities and accomplishments in terms of the position to be filled

nbnbnbb
- Review your experience and your qualifications:
Suppose,
for example, that your ability to solve marketing problems or reduce production costs is a
significant feature of your experience and would be a valuable benefit to your prospective
employer. Be prepared to offer specifics about the savings or profits that
resulted form your efforts, or about other contributions you’ve made to the success of
companies you’ve worked for.

“I don’t know the answer, but if I were to venture an
educated guess I would say…”

How I dealt with the users? Managed my staff? Employed
technology?”

Emphasise the result of your work. How did your experience and labour create something
positive? Reduce costs? Increase Productivity? Streamline workflow? State, clearly and
concisely, your duties and responsibilities on each job, focussing on:
- Particular problems / challenges you encountered
- Your solution
- How you implemented those solutions
- How you will bring the same skills to bear for a new employer

ANSWERING THE “TELL ME ABOUT YOURSELF” QUESTION
They don't want to know about your family, your last
vacation, your hobbies, your religious beliefs, that you like the Cubs, or that
you are a proud member of AA.
It would be an easy question to answer if
candidates answered with a prepared and well thought-out initial marketing
statement of themselves and their skills
Jerryco Ruperto <jerryco.ruperto@sofico.jp>
Part one of that three-part
marketing statement is always a one-sentence summary of the
candidate's career history. For example, let me share with you a
former candidate's opening sentence:
summary of a single accomplishment that you are proud of that will
also capture the potential employer's attention.

@2Billionaire
“I am a five-year veteran of LAN/WAN Admin and Systems
Engineering with substantial experience using Novell, NT, Cisco, and
Lotus Notes/Domino. 
Recently, as a long-term contract employee at
a local regional bank, I learned they were about to install Lotus
Notes/Domino and were planning to use outside consultants for the
project. I let them know I had done a similar installation at my last
assignment, outlined how we could get the job done with in-house
staff, and successfully completed the install for $55-65k less than it
would have cost with outside consultants. 
For the next step in my
career, I would like to move away from contract work and find
myself as a direct employee of a large firm where I could join a
substantial IT team and be involved with a group that focused on
email and network security applications, while having access to the
knowledgebase that would come with a large, diverse IT group.”

security, and application issues for the users of the organization. As
the firm's IT needs grew, I would love to apply my past team project

it needs to specifically address what you want to do next, AND it needs to
change from interview to interview to make sure it matches exactly what the
INDIVIDUAL employers will be interviewing you for.



Part two of the pre-planned marketing statement will be a one-, maybe two sentence
summary of a single accomplishment that you are proud of that will
also capture the potential employer's attention. It immediately follows your
initial career summary sentence from above. This accomplishment should be
one that the employer will be interested in hearing, one that is easily
explained or illustrated, and one that clearly highlights a bottom line impact.

Hi Mphathi
all members of the team are not happy with the way candice is treating them
they feel like they are in high school and have to be monitored daily by candice
they raised issues that they are not happy with the arrangement of coming to the office everyday in April
and they prefer sitting upstairs
and they have raised the concern that they will make other plans, I tried to talk to them individually but they made it clear to me that I should deliver the message to you before they take further steps  because that does not sit well with them, the M3 are also complaining
I informed them that I will have a chat to with you first before not to take any further steps   
Not sure maybe you can assist them with their complains , however they don't mind coming to the office 2 to 3 days

Selling is transferrimg of feelings or emotions 
If you feel that some product is good if you transfere that feeling to your prospects he wants to buy
actually you are not selling to him  , he wants to buy from you but you have to give him that feeling thathe needs, it is good for himshow web office
network marketing is very good business if you have results you have good commission if you dont have results you dont have commission 

have self confidencw to build business then start ,if you need money badly then you work badly,you work hard 
start working like crazy
49:52 
you can't get money if you don't work or invest in anything
many people don't want to call people ,to talk to them , to learn something about network marketing 
work 12 hours a day


there is no posibility to offer that kind of return of investment so far ,if check all those companies they are all scams 

ask fouders to prolong this promotion to next month

---FML-3294 3201 datacase script====

We are fixing the null values on  Tyre make and tyre model columns,it is a training issue
some users selected Tyre type and then clicked on save button instead of clicking calculate button ,hence the Tyre model and Tyre make have null values on the the database, Once users select Tyre type they were supposed to click on calculate button in order to populate tyre model and Tyre make

On the save button we created a validating method to force users to click on calculate button once they have selected tyre type





This has an impact on Customer or Supplier reports - the BI Reporting is formulating incorrectly , it is pulling all orders as blank causing incorrect reporting
Financial Impact - due to incorrect reporting being captured, financial specification per brand and make of tyre cannot be reported on



---------
Materiality - when Tyre ID not being used Work Orders are still allowed to be approved (Miles should hard block) when Tyre ID being used, Tyre make and model not pulling through/populating


  

2nd issue is that a script must be created to fix the null values on tyre model field and Tyre make field, Pieter said he will assist with the script
3dly Sofico wants to charge  us 8 hours to implement new solution or for guiding us to create a new solution but I want to attempt it first

add it as part of M3
risk that work can be lost



Hi Sader, Huzaifah I just listened to the recording of the meeting that we had with Pieter which can be found above or be downloaded here Call with Sader, Huzaifah-20220905_112533-Meeting Recording.mp4 (sharepoint.com) , the only issue we discussed in that meeting is the tyre validation( for example tyre make and tyre model), you will have to log another ticket to do validation on the entire work order screen, 

for now we have to focus on testing tyre make and tyre model as indicated on this ticket (INC3933806:FML-3201), 
validating the entire screen can be added as part of M3 because there is a risk that work can be lost because that is a big change Warmest Regards Mandla

prevent Debit Order run problems on Miles




Last week experienced some issue with debit orders because of one customer  did not have an account number, 
this fix is going to resolve that issue and  check if all customers have all required data before we can proceed with debit orders. 



This solution must be presented to ECAB first before we can deploy it to prod but we also need your approval before we can present it to ECAB.

I made 300 into 1000$ already just simply from investing in a whole ecosystem, hyperfund will pay me 0.5% a day that is generated from their whole ecosystem until they've paid me 3x my money, theres a option to compound every 50$ and if I do that I can 10x my money!
On top of that you get commissions for referals, so not only does people get 3-10x their own money they can paid additionally for showing others a great place to put some money to grow!

My name is Nick Cleijne, I wrote the Linked Social book and in the book I included 5 steps to dominate your LinkedIn lead generation.
It's a 90-page book that goes over a system I developed that gets me 25-40 qualified leads on LinkedIn for free every single month.
? It does not involve advertising
? It does not involve spamming people
? You don�t have to be an expert to do it too
Here are a few things you'll discover in the 100 pages of the Linked Social Book:
 Discover the exact step-by-step process for determining your ideal customers and how to find them
(All explained on page 12)�
 How to get instant followers for your company page (for free!)
(Explained on page 10)�
 The exact steps you need to create a perfect profile that resonates with your Ideal Customer Profiles
(Revealed on page 15)...
 The secrets to understanding the LinkedIn Algorithm & how to use it to your advantage
(See Page 25 to see how it really works behind the scenes )�
 The 11 ways to find inspiration for your content (instead of re-inventing the wheel)
(Explained on Page 28)�
 How to get people to actually read your posts (and how to write copy that converts)

 The different formats that you can use for your LinkedIn content and which one you should use
(Outlined on page 41)�
How to pick the right LinkedIn group and to become a thought leader in it (without being spammy)

 The secret to switch to autopilot completely and only overview the whole machine
(Turn to page 82)� 
 How to reach out to ideal clients and get 35-75% acceptance rates (on autopilot!)

  On overview of handy tools you can use to boost your results instantly.
(Check out page 67�)
 How you can have advanced automation in place that works harder and more efficiently than any employee you could hire

Hi everyone                                                                                               I hope you are keeping well in these strange times . I am in the middle of some important calls and can�t chat, but I have a minute to run something past you. I started an online business about a month ago... good timing.

Would you be open-minded enough to take a look , very simple generating passive returns

Thanks Mandla

you will have a formula that will check the value of your qualifier to dermine which item is going to do
This is going to be the opposite of what we had on first exersize with the business partner 

The formula on the predecessor that will choose which activity you are going to do based on the setting of 
your qualifier for your provider

I spend almost 2 weeks without access on miles ,I couldnt access the environment
I was experiencing
10/21/2020 from the 20th of october to 23rd of october

That it is because either the certificate is invalid, or that there is malware present or both.

Hi Alan,

Hope you are well, the same issue persist again on MILES RIA training environment 13
https://trainingapp13extria.sofico.be/milesria/#tab_0
The issue is that the environment is no longer accessible due to privacy issue.

Exploratory research is defined as a research used to investigate a problem which is not clearly defined. It is conducted to have a better understanding of the existing problem, but will not provide conclusive results. For such a research, a researcher starts with a general idea and uses this research as a medium to identify issues, that can be the focus for future research. An important aspect here is that the researcher should be willing to change his/her direction subject to the revelation of new data or insight. Such a research is usually carried out when the problem is at a preliminary stage. It is often referred to as grounded theory approach or interpretive research as it used to answer questions like what, why and how.

Figure 4.4.2.1 represents graphical representation of discovered success ways to overcome barriers of Enterprise Architecture adoption, therefore this increases  the likelihood of success for initiatives of Enterprise Architecture.  This shows a significant improvement in  perceived success which includes: to promote knowledge sharing among  EA team and the employees,    increased involvement of stakeholders/ EA users  in development of Enterprise Architecture,  frequently  communicating Enterprise Architecture success stories and related issues ,constant communication concerning the Enterprise Architecture goals and  purpose ,  increasing involvement of management on Enterprise Architecture(Gebayew, et al., 2018). Considering the mean values of each response, an average/mean was calculated. The mean of the 5 responses  presented on Table 4.4.2.1 above was 4.42 meaning many of respondents  had chosen a score more  than 4 in the scale of 0 to 7.

Therefore it is clearly understood that enterprise architecture is  facilitating successful flow of information therefore promotes knowledge management in
 the organization.

In addition, information Technology is  promoting the storage, digital capture, dissemination and retrieval of knowledge. Therefore,  knowledge management systems which are technology driven are aiming to facilitate the knowledge transfer from the holders of knowledge who  originally created and experienced knowledge  to some organizational members  that may  benefit from the similar knowledge (Ramy, et al., 2018). However, it is vital noting  that executing 1  or more of such tools is not a simple and seemingly magical solution to a complicated problem to overcome the weakness of the knowledge sharing processes for the organization (Aldea, et al., 2018).

and  verified by the research literature: In addition, Banaeianjahromi, et al. (2016) discovered reasons why EA is frequently carried out: Enterprise architecture develops a usual organizational language, Enterprise architecture is making  it possible to expand, promote, or  plan communication and information  systems, Enterprise architecture assists  organizations to replace uncertain systems, Enterprise architecture repeats or promotes  foundations of communications and information technology, Enterprise architecture assists  organizations to manage change, Enterprise architecture develops agreement between the organization�s communications, information and  operational technology layers.  The above mentioned reasons indicate that the EA role in organizations is vital and is more intensified and because it is critical for companies to function with more capability of  providing  attractive products or services to their clients,  although, of late, and as confirmed by this research, Enterprise Architecture plays an important role  in the asset finance and motor vehicle industry(Centobelli, et al., 2017). Therefore  participants  know what Enterprise Architecture  does and  believe it plays an  important role in their organization.

Fatemeh, et al. (2017) argued that the perspective of enterprise architecture as an artefact is aiming  to offer a strategic holistic perspective of the enterprise consequently allows conducting, integration and  coherent coordination of organizational activities. 


Schilling (2018) highlighted  that the enterprise architect captures the requirement and concerns  of enterprise architecture stakeholders by developing perspectives of the architecture which illustrates to the EA stakeholders what kind of compromises are going  to taken in  addressing each  conflict among concerns of various  stakeholders, and how their requirement and concerns are going to be addressed. It implies that EA  is anticipated to harmonize each and every concern and requirement of different  stakeholders and implementing  architectures which are addressing  as many of those requirements and concerns  as possible.

///
In addition, the change management  principles must  be cautiously twisted together with the implementation of EA so that numerous requirements of all stakeholders are addressed. Meanwhile it is impossible catering for each and every  requirement, where an agreement is done, communication should be made clear so that agreement is not leading to lack of satisfaction on the  stakeholder side which is  affected by EA(Kaisler & Armour, 2017).
///////////
 - Support and communication  is described by (Canat, et al., 2018) as keeping and informing each and every enterprise architecture stakeholder informed about the enterprise architecture  related activities and issues. In addition this involves continuous support provided to enterprise architecture stakeholders throughout  enterprise architecture implementation and planning. Communication which is effective allows  knowledge sharing  and  assists in establishing usual understanding of the agreed  artefacts, models, objectives,  vision, scope and goals.

Additionally it is important to give an insight into the barriers experienced throughout the adoption of EA.

The organization�s architecture development  is generally carried out utilizing industry mechanisms that involve � architecture development tools; IT industry enterprise architecture frameworks and models; enterprise architecture IT industry standards;  architecture principles; methods to develop an enterprise architecture and IT industry techniques� (Minoli, 2018).

The updated or new enterprise architectures must  take into consideration the availability of tools or frameworks to develop a new one or  to modify the existing enterprise architectures,  the organization�s desired or  updated strategy, the organization�s practices and principles, enterprise architecture standards, IT assets as well as  existing EA. The outcome of such synthesis is going to be an  updated/new EA standard, updated/new information technology  strategies, Updated/ new EA standard, and the roadmap that identifies the information technology projects needed to implement or execute the modified/ new architecture and obtain deployment plan and as well as the  target state . Additionally, effectiveness assessment, environmental monitoring,  as well as governance are key functions.


Fatemeh, et al. (2017) argued that the perspective of enterprise architecture as an artefact is aiming  to offer a strategic holistic perspective of the enterprise consequently allows conducting, integration and  coherent coordination of organizational activities. Furthermore, Weill, et al( 2018a) proposed that the success of organizational changes are outcomes of integrating and identifying each and every  variable of an organization for example systems, people , processes, structure and  culture. In such view, enterprise architecture is regarded as a strategic tool which allows organizational governance (Saint-Louis, et al., 2017). In such circumstance , enterprise architecture is viewed to be placed among development initiatives and strategic planning  (Alzoubi, et al., 2018).

The purpose  explored in this part can allow a researcher to create an instrument which is effective for gathering data. In addition, this will ensure the possibility of relating  other previous findings to the present literature.  An environment where the company is operating is specified by relentless change and ever-increasing complexity .


Continutyyyyyy
Constant pressure exists from organizational external forces (e.g.  technological trends, mergers and acquisitions, economic changes,  regulations and laws,  client preferences and needs) which is putting more pressure on companies so that they align their information technology and business  domains to allow them to reply  to the environmental changes as a result of allowing their continuity (Niemi, 2016).

share 23
is done with the objective of creating  a more understanding about  how sharing of knowledge among people  in a project environment occurs. 
It is essential in this study�s context  due to the fact that management of 
framework shown in Fig.8.27  which states that eliminating inhibitors to sharing  of knowledge  and the supply of proper motivators could  be leading to an effective and efficient sharing of knowledge in projects therefore  leads  to a better  probability for success  of the project.

As stated by model  of Israilidis (2015), there is a vital  relationship among the project success and effectiveness of knowledge sharing throughout the project . In addition they discovered that the success  of the project is improved  by how and when the sharing of explicit and tacit knowledge is occurring.
24 Source (Gebayew, 2018)
Likewise, Chigada , et al. (2015)  argues that companies could  benefit more  by sharing and capturing  both explicit and tacit  knowledge in the community  of project management. Managers of projects to the greatest extent  adopt  (1) sharing of repository for project artefacts,  (2) content and document  management systems,  (3) best practices repositories and lessons learned as practices  of knowledge management to assist  them.
25
In addition , Ouali, et al. (2016) states  that successful execution  of knowledge management is very important to the success of project management,  that can in turn change the company to excellence. Additionally he highlights the significance to  embed knowledge management during project management lifecycle due to the fact that the company�s  knowledge asset base continues  to grow,  every project should be constructed on the knowledge assets and sharing  the knowledge.

25 SHARE
Kaczmarek-He� and De Kinderen (2017) states that this is a regularly held perspective  between  practitioners and researchers  that information technology has a possibility of facilitating  the rapid retrieval, accessing, and also searching  of previously retained and captured  information. It allows organizational members to effectively collaborate  and share knowledge(communicate) .

26
These initiatives and technologies may span greater  than 1 phase  of knowledge management as represented graphically in Figure 2.3. The technologies are  having a vital role in fulfilling  management of  knowledge  shared, stored , and created  throughout the adoption of enterprise architecture.
28
Organizational culture was emphasized as an important  factor in establishing  the accomplishment  of knowledge sharing strategies (Kotusev, 2017a). Nevertheless , Alwadain, et al., (2016) states that an organizational culture which  is supportive of knowledge management , �is highly valuing knowledge  and  persuades its application,  sharing , and creation via  the individual�s empowerment  to explore new approaches and possibilities �.

29
 It essential  to give an insight into the level  to which stakeholders of EA believe that the  efforts of EA can benefit from promotion or introduction of knowledge management activities like giving the important  tools which enable the EA team and other employees to collaborate or  promoting a culture of knowledge sharing .

Information  technology is  playing an essential  role in the knowledge management as it accelerates the knowledge transfer  and broadens the reach . In addition, information Technology is  promoting the storage, digital capture, dissemination and retrieval of knowledge. Therefore,  knowledge management systems which are technology-driven are aiming to facilitate the knowledge transfer from the holders of knowledge who  originally created and experienced knowledge  to some   organizational members  that may  benefit from the similar knowledge (Serenko, et al., 2015).

Hence, it is essential to inspire organizational members  to adopt and learn new manners of thinking and /or  working.

Insufficient awareness of  Enterprise Architecture: Having to emerge from Information Systems Engineering as a technical domain, enterprise architecture is still to fully identify the importance  of  a company�s social factors like communication, organizational, and also human  behavior . Additionally , new strategy utilization often  meets  behavioral resistance, as the organizational goals  may not be embraced/ shared by other organizational members .

STAKEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEHOLDER
Delivery of Enterprise Architecture value proposition :To deliver a tangible enterprise architecture value proposition  is still one of the  big issues  for companies . Consequently, the value proposition of EAM requires  �...to be conveyed to the correct stakeholders in the correct manner and its execution must be viewed to be beneficial�(Kaidalova, et al., 2017).
From the discussed challenges, it is understandable that the EA or the enterprise architect  team  should  be given the opportunity to sell the requirement  for enterprise architect  to stakeholders, users and  management in a manner which is properly defining the benefits that EA is bringing to the enterprise.

Likewise, J�ntti, et al. (2018) decided to  investigate the relationship among organizational culture and KM  and  discovered that even though the relationship among  these 2 is difficult  complex, existing  evidence shows that interventions of KM are leading  to change  organizational culture. Therefore knowledge management may be utilized  to develop an organizational culture which is  promoting adoption of EA.

Additionally a survey  was utilized to give an insight into the barriers experienced throughout the adoption of EA. It was selected  to give an insight into the level  to which stakeholders of EA believe that the  efforts of EA can benefit from promotion or introduction of knowledge management activities like giving the important  tools which enable the EA team and other employees to collaborate or  promoting a culture of knowledge sharing .

Meanwhile it is impossible  catering for each and every  requirement, where an agreement is done, communication should be made clear so that agreement is

Data quality & Consolidation : Alwadain, et al.

It is leading  to complex and a heterogeneous application structure. Quality of data  may be evaluated  on various  dimensions like consistency, reliability, integrity, and completeness. Data quality which is low implies that it is frequently impossible to supply  enterprise architecture stakeholders and  other managers  with the current  information on time.

culture
J�ntti, et al. (2018) argues that it is  at the theory of the  knowledge management core where  organizational culture and knowledge management are securely entwined. Moreover, the existing literature is  revealing .
Organizational culture is an important section of the context. The term organizational culture includes difficult ideas, that are making it hard to comprehensively describe it. One description, Schilling (2018) in O'Leary (2019) describes organizational culture as �a pattern of shared expectations and beliefs which are governing  the manner organizational members behave�.


Organizational culture was emphasized as an important  factor in establishing  the accomplishment  of knowledge sharing strategies (Kotusev, 2017a). Nevertheless , Alwadain, et al., (2016) states that an organizational culture which  is supportive of knowledge management , �is highly valuing knowledge  and  persuades its application,  sharing , and creation via  the individual�s empowerment  to explore new approaches and possibilities �.

The important finding of this study is that transformational leadership style has a greater

commitment.
This finding also led us to conclude that
transformational leadership is a better predictor of employee commitment.

According to the results of the research, there is a positive and significant relationship
between transactional leadership style and only normative commitment. This reflects that
leadership behaviors, which involve recognizing accomplishments taking immediate action or

Additionally, enterprise architecture  offers descriptive and tangible artefacts which allows this company to decode its complexity and helps it to cope with change. Meanwhile there is no solidarity on the description of enterprise architecture, 1 of the broadly cited description is provided by Niemi and Pekkola (2017), their perspective is that enterprise architecture is an approach to �managing the  complexity of business environment, IT(information technology)  and organization�s structure,  facilitating the business , personnel, IT and integration of strategy with regards to usual objective via  the use and production of structural models offering  a holistic perspective of the company� (Niemi & Pekkola, 2017).

Information technology became an important enabler for business as it allows companies to make use of  new capabilities and opportunities provided by latest technologies so that they can gain competitive advantage in the markets where they are operating. Due to the fact that enterprise architecture is being utilized more in aligning  organizational strategy with information technology , the success of its adoption is vital to business.

When enterprise architecture began, EA was an information technology-centric function (Shanks, et al., 2018). Enterprise architecture started to evolve as a regulation and currently it is deemed to be  offering company�s  high-ranking  holistic view of the whole  �Business to Information Technology� stack covering organizational structure, business processes,  information technology and software  infrastructure (Sia, et

Graphical View of responses to Question 31
The data indicated that most participants had five years or more of teaching experience. The most prevalent innovation among the group was e-learning. Most participants indicated that they were intermediate users of the rated innovations suggesting that most of them were intermediate technology users comfortable with the idea of using technology for instructional use. The data also showed that it�s only a minimal number of respondents who had received formal training with the use of innovations for instructional use.


/////////////
The three research questions guiding this study, presented in Chapter 1, are addressed herein by utilizing the results evolving from the aggregate data from the qualitative and quantitative analysis employed in this study, with reference to the pertinent literature on technical and vocational education and skills training (TVET).

Five essential findings emerged from the discussion of the question: (a)

The findings generated significant data forming the foundation of the conclusions of this descriptive study

Results and findings from Research Questions 2 and 3 also produced interesting and relevant data from the participants� viewpoints. Conclusions emerging from Research Questions 2 and 3 strengthened the answers to Research Question 1. For instance

The three research questions and their conclusions are interrelated; they support and reinforce each other. Each of the research questions, with the associated conclusions, is discussed below.
One finding of the study was that the people look down on TVET students as inferior or not intelligent enough to attend regular secondary school. Others think they cannot withstand the rigors of regular university education. Students attending TVET schools are looked down upon as non-progressive and as failures academically.
A conclusion arrived at from this finding is that the limited government support (or absence of support) for TVET schools has consigned those attending the schools and
EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Evidence shows that such opinions and perceptions are completely wrong; many of the TVET graduates have moved on to the University and earned higher degrees. Other talented individuals started practicing one form of vocational trade or another immediately after graduation because the skills and knowledge they acquired empowered them to be creative, innovative, and self-reliant. The skills and knowledge acquired from TVET schools and programs enabled some to establish their own workshops as well as cottage industries at their homes or at rented properties
EEEEEEEEEEEE
Another major finding of this study was that most parents in Nigeria only send their children/wards to TVET schools as a last resort because of its poor public image. As a result, most parents want their children/wards to attend regular secondary schools as well as the University and become real professionals. Findings show that a majority of parents want their children to become doctors, lawyers, accountants, teachers, or any other big-name careers recognized by the society.
A conclusion extrapolated from the findings is that the failure of the government to give technical and vocational education and training schools and programs the attention they deserve is among the major forces behind the poor patronage of TVET
150
schools and programs in Nigeria. Lack of proper information or awareness about the importance of the TVET schools and programs may have caused the �confusion and distrust� (Agnes) in the society. In addition, distrust is one of the major forces behind the poor patronage of TVET schools and programs and their low social status in Nigeria.
Is there inadequate provision of training/teaching materials in technical/vocational schools? Another significant finding of the study showed there is an inadequate provision of learning and teaching materials in technical and vocational schools and programs in Nigeria. Also, teachers in TVET schools are the least respected in the teaching profession; thus, the reason for their lower social standing. In particular, the TVET teachers are not properly motivated in terms of payment of salaries and benefits when compared to their counterparts with the same qualification in the university system. More often than not, the teachers are not paid their basic salaries for months, negatively affecting their morale and productivity. They cannot perform their duties to the students effectively without proper motivation and the provision of necessary learning and teaching tools and equipment.
A conclusion drawn from such facts is that the lack of provision of modern teaching and learning technologies has prevented the teachers from producing high-quality graduates. Another conclusion is that such deficiencies have posed real challenges to teaching and learning in the institutions. The teachers and students cannot perform miracles without the necessary learning and teaching resources. One way to improve the productivity of the nation�s TVET teachers is to provide better conditions of services (train them well and update their skills) and adequate funding for the TVET
151
institutions to procure the needed teaching and learning tools. Such provisions will boost their morale and increase their productivity

- The study successfully introduced and subsequently validated three additional
constructs to the UTAUT model (trusting beliefs, information/system quality, and
information/system satisfaction), making it the first study of its kind to apply such
a research model in exploring usage behavior. Also, the study took place in an
area that has not been studied in this way before (K�12 education).
- As theorized in the alternate model, trusting beliefs, information/system quality,
and information/system satisfaction perfectly fit in explaining usage behavior
without the impact of the moderating variables (age, gender, and experience).
These findings were not consistent with the UTAUT and might compel rethinking
the empirical base of that theory.
- The findings provided an empirical base to build an improved unified theory of
acceptance and use of technology that can be applied across different cultures.
- The findings enhanced our understanding of the viability of the UTAUT model
across economic and social contexts, and across a cross-section of users (e.g.,
116
experienced vs. novice users, early vs. late adopters, voluntary vs. non-voluntary
users).
- The alternate model can be employed to conduct both explanatory and
confirmatory studies in other technological settings (e.g., organizational, higher
learning institutions).
- Apart from the moderating variables (age, gender, and experience), this research
validated the UTAUT as established by Vankatesh et al. (2003) in the K�12
environment.
In sum, the this study has contributed a new knowledge in the area of information
technology adoption and usage within the context of K�12 education.
////
5.6.3 Practical Implications
The findings of the study identified cultural factors such as trusting beliefs,
information/system quality, and information/system satisfaction that impacted the use of
the LCMS at Queens College. The practical implications of the key findings provide
significant benefits to all stakeholders (students, parents, teachers, and school
administrators) in promoting the objectives of the school.
- The findings indicate that improved communications (including regular computermediated
communication) between the school and home appear to impact
positively the performance and progress of students. This factor suggests that the
LCMS can be used to encourage greater communication between the home and
school, which in turn can have an indirect, but positive impact on student
achievement and behaviors.
- The findings indicate that the school administrators can devise the LCMS
implementation and training plan/program with little consideration for variables
such as age, gender, and level of experience in using technology.
- In spite of the novelty of the LCMS at Queens College, the findings indicate that
the vast majority of respondents felt at ease using the system. The frequency and
regular use of the system suggests an extension to facilitate other non-school
related activities such as governance, fund raising, and various types of nonacademic
activities/planning might be successful.
- The findings indicate that fewer influences exist that potentially discourage
parents from using this technology. The school might successfully use this
channel to increase the number of parents using the technology by encouraging
118
those who do use the system to convey their positive experiences to those who do
not.

 Alwadain, et al. (2016) advise that �even  when you are  having the smartest technique, you require to find individuals  to implement it in a company and every time you are working with human beings you must  handle emotions,  sometimes that  may be totally unpredictable�. Hence, it is essential to inspire organizational members  to adopt and learn new manners of thinking and /or  working. Working with  difficult  tasks frequently  demand  techniques that are complex  which are usually complicated  to teach and other times even harder to sketch graphically.

The findings indicated on the graph proved to be statistically significant

The respondents were requested to show whether Enterprise Architecture is having required support  from  management.
Figure 4.4.5.4  above depicts the findings:
The aim is to  establish if Enterprise Architecture is having required support  from  management. It is important noting that of the 85 participants,  79 responded to this question .The figure above shows minimum value  of  7.59%  and maximum value  of 54.43% , a high score indicated on the graph shows a strong degree of the positive impact and the low score shows a low impact. The graph indicates that majority   54.43%  of the respondents agree that Enterprise Architecture is having required support  from  management.  Based on these outcomes indicated on the figure , the majority states that they agree with the aforementioned statement it should. The Figure 4.4.5.4 shows that there is a significant relationship between  Enterprise Architecture and the required support  from  management. This ,implies  that Enterprise Architecture is receiving  support  from  management.

The answers given by the participants indicate consistency regarding  outlining the effectiveness of EA on continuity of company's knowledge . It became clear that respondents understand the role that EA play at their company. It  was revealed via  the participant�s response,  minimum 6.25% respondents reported that continuity of company's knowledge became worse as the result of EA. Some participants , maximum of 55.00% articulated to above mentioned perception, they reported that EA has an impact on continuity of company's knowledge, continuity of company's knowledge was  improved as an outcome of EA. These finding were verified by the literature: constant pressure exists from organizational external forces (e.g.  technological trends, mergers and acquisitions, economic changes,  laws and regulations,  client needs and preferences) which is putting more pressure on companies so that they align their information technology and business  domains to allow them to reply to the environmental changes as a result of allowing their continuity (Niemi, 2016).

This distribution can also be depicted in

Table 4.3.4.1 and Table 4.3.4.2 shows that samples are determined by utilizing years of employments (1 � 5,6 �10, and so on) for us to trace them as we manipulate them. The value is the number of years of employment that individuals spent at the organization. The unit used is frequency (denoted by the symbol �f�).

However, we cannot easily see the proportions of the various outcomes easily, while in the pie graph on the right we can almost immediately see that almost half of the time, the outcome will be a 6, 7 or 8. Presenting the results of a study will generally require a mixture of both text and
graphics. It is generally not sufficient to present graphics and expect a reader to gain the understanding we expect them to immediately. Explanatory text explicitly stating the intended meaning is required in order to ensure that the
reader has understood the point being made.

Inspection of Table 4 reveals that participative leadership style (r = 0.066, p > 0.05) has
no statistically significant relationship with performance. Based on these results, the null
hypothesis (Ho1), which states that participative leadership style does not lead to
achievement of the objectives of a strategic plan, should not be rejected

Kaczmarek-He� and De Kinderen (2017) states that this is a regularly held perspective  between  practitioners and researchers  that information technology has a possibility of facilitating  the rapid retrieval, accessing, and also searching  of previously retained and captured  information.

Therefore,  knowledge management systems which are technology-driven are aiming to facilitate the knowledge transfer from the holders of knowledge who  originally created and experienced knowledge  to some   organizational members  that may  benefit from the similar knowledge (Serenko, et al., 2015).

Collaboration and improvement of Organizational Communication� there was  a causal  association among improvements and enterprise architecture in both inter- and intra-organizational communication and also  enhancing inter-organizational information sharing,  collaboration, as well as improvement of intra-organizational trust.


Moreover, Gilliland, et al. (2015) stated that �when enterprise architecture is generally believed to be valid, the company is having the benefits of gathering  knowledge regarding  how individuals included  in enterprise architecture operate. Retaining and capturing helpful knowledge of human might be resulting  in an information which is reusable.� Therefore it is clearly understood that enterprise architecture is  facilitating successful flow of information therefore promotes knowledge management in a company .


1.	What are the roles of Enterprise Architecture in the asset finance and motor vehicle industry, in Gauteng?
2.	What is the impact of knowledge management in increasing the potential success of enterprise architecture in the organization?
3.	What are the barriers to adoption of enterprise architecture in asset finance and motor vehicle industry., in Gauteng? My company is having open-minded technique to  the changes necessitated by Enterprise Architecture and new ways of doing work


Kotusev (2017a) provided an enterprise architecture  metaphor that recognizes the effective nature of enterprise architecture , recommending that a greater metaphor EA can be �transforming a skyscraper into a totally different skyscraper meanwhile everybody that resides in the first skyscraper still lives there�. He states that enterprise architecture is not just about doing documentation, additionally it is regarding modelling and transformation  for change.  Nevertheless, adoption of enterprise architecture is a resource intensive undertaking that needs remarkable investments in effort, costs and time .
As an outcome, enterprise architecture which is  poorly executed  results in remarkable problems and losses  for this company . Nevertheless, enterprise architecture implementation which is  successful provides a broad range of benefits to this  company, involving  more effective decision-making processes, cost savings, reduced complexity, the strategic capability arising from the better digital business platform and successful delivery of transformation projects built throughout the transformation (Tamm, et al., 2015).

////
The Figure 4.4.5.10 shows that there is a significant relationship between enterprise architecture and organizational performance.

When introducing transformation to the  organization�s strategy  , the organization�s enterprise architectures might require some improvement based on identified gaps.





In addition this study  was measuring the acceptance  of the EA adoption barriers (discussed in chapter 2), in the organization which is taking part.

This graph indicates  the response given by the different respondents . On the graph  , we may easily see the relationship among  the different outcomes and their response . Minimum value: 5.88% of respondents said �I know what Enterprise Architecture  does, but do not believe it is important� and the other 5.88% reported that �I did not know Enterprise Architecture exists� the shortest response of all the test subject. Maximum value: 72.94% of respondents said �I know what Enterprise Architecture  does and I believe it is important� the longest response  of all the test subjects)




Reduction of IT Costs and Increases in IT Value -  It was discovered that applying enterprise architecture  enhances the information technology ROI(return on investment ). In addition, applying  enterprise architecture optimizes the information technology investments value. However , it was also  discovered that enterprise architecture is  leading  to lowering  of both indirect and direct information technology costs. Direct information technology  costs involve costs linked to information technology operations costs and also application maintenance.
The findings  reported that majority of the age group of the staff who participated is both  18 � 24 years(25.9%) and 40-44 years(25.9%) ,
followed by 30-34 years(23.5%) and minority is 25-29(10.6%). Age is the other expected  factor that   might establish the role of 
knowledge management support for enterprise architecture adoption and its impact on organizational performance in a certain bank . 

84.45/1420.60
Figure 4.3.2. is  illustrating that the majority of  staff members who  participated  on this research are 70.6%  males   
and the minority are females at 29.4%. The illustration may  reveal certain perception regarding the research ;  as various  
genders are perceiving the similar challenges differently.


Figure 4.3.3. emphasized that the highest level of  qualified  staff members are undergraduate degree holders at 68.24% followed by 
post graduate degree holders and  minority are under matric holders. The qualifications  is having an important  role to play in the 
role of knowledge management support for enterprise architecture adoption as it determines  its impact on organizational performance. 
The highest qualification level is linked to the best known influence and power that  is �French and Raven's Five Forms of Power� 
(Karvonen, Sharp and Barroca, 2018:131) The model emphasizes 3 kinds of positional power � coercive, reward, and legitimate and  2 
personal power sources  referent and expert  (individual�s charm and personal appeal ). This model mentions that 1  must  work on 
developing expert power, and utilizing  personal power is the greater alternative( a power which is coming with being an expert on the job) 
due to the fact that it is more legitimate personal power source that may be achieved via  education.

SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT
For the reason that Enterprise Architecture is being utilized more in aligning  organizational strategy with information technology , the success of its adoption is vital to business.


the fact that IT plays an  important role as an organizational strategy  enabler  it is  essential  that the strategy of information technology  is continuously aligned with the organizational strategy. EA allows such alignment. It is essential   reviewing  the current literature so that one can understand  and appreciate the significance of the  success of  Enterprise Architecture  to enterprises.


The continuous change in operating environment where  organizations are operating  demands  that organizational strategies to be  reviewed continuously and modified so that it can respond constructively to such changes, and the fact that IT plays an  important role as an organizational strategy  enabler  it is  essential  that the strategy of information technology  is continuously aligned with the organizational strategy. EA allows such alignment.

Enterprise Architecture is creating unified information technology throughout  the organization with symbiotic links which is tight to organizational strategy and business side of an enterprise.

In most cases  an organization is having business strategy and also a group of business assets. It is important for an organization to create an information technology infrastructure which is going to back up future information technology environment state that is going to facilitate,  support, and  enable the organization�s strategy. To obtain such , in most cases organizations create  Enterprise Architectures that are illustrating technology environment, systems environment and  organization�s information.

When introducing transformation to the  organization�s strategy  , the organization�s Enterprise Architectures might require some improvement based on identified gaps.
The updated or new Enterprise Architectures must  take into consideration the EA standards, IT assets, existing EA, the desired or organization�s updated strategy , the organization�s practices and principles , as well as the tools to modify the existing EA or availability of frameworks or to create develop a new one. 




In chapter 2 literature review under section 2.3 the current role of EA in the asset finance and motor vehicle industry it was indicated that  different views of EA are very important, it is vital noting that  Enterprise Architecture is existing primarily  to offer more understanding of an organization, by combining  the surrounding business environment, strategies, goals, the business drivers, via organizational roles ,  business processes, responsibilities and combining  them to the basis of information technology systems which the organization relies on, the findings support that statement and indicate that majority of respondents 72.9% of the respondents know what Enterprise Architecture  does in the organization and  believe it is important.(Centobelli, et al., 2017).


Literature review supports these findings,  it was discussed on literature review section 2.3   that  that  additional  to enterprise architecture  assisting to determine a company�s   �execution foundation�, enterprise architecture also allows  companies to integrate their process standards as well as reusing  and consolidating their business processes. Enterprise Architecture improves agility, process change, business change and flexibility.


As indicated on literature review

The findings  were supported by the present  literature ,it was mentioned on the literature review  that  the spread  of recent regulations and also the growth in requirements of compliance  are challenging specifically  for companies which operate  in the  utilities, insurance, telecommunication, and banking sectors.

Tasks which are complex need complex approaches : Alwadain, et al. (2016) advise that �even  when you are  having the smartest technique  , you require to find individuals  to implement it in a company and every time you are working  with human beings you must to handle emotions,  sometimes that  may be totally unpredictable�. Hence , it is essential  to inspire organizational members  to adopt and learn new manners of thinking and /or  working. Working with  difficult  tasks frequently  demand  techniques that are complex  which are usually complicated  to teach and other times even harder to sketch graphically.

n of knowledge management activities like giving the important  tools which enable the EA team and other employees to collaborate or  promoting a culture of knowledge sharing .

////////
The updated or new enterprise architectures must  take into consideration the EA standards, IT assets, existing EA, the desired or organization�s updated strategy , the organization�s practices and principles , as well as the tools to modify the existing EA or availability of frameworks or to create a new one.  The outcome of such synthesis is going to be an  updated/new EA standard, modified/new IT strategies, Updated/ new EA, and a roadmap that identifies the information technology projects needed to implement or execute the modified/ new architecture and obtain a deployment plan and as well as the  target state . Additionally, effectiveness assessment, environmental monitoring,  as well as governance are key functions.

This is equivalent to Zachman�s description.  As a programme management Bernard pointed out that enterprise architecture is taken into consideration as a method of  �resource development, decision-making , and planning on a specific level and also on a general level�.
In such point of view, it is critical for enterprise architecture to be regarded  as a component which is integrated for  general governance structure of the organization. This allows  enterprise architecture  to take part in attempts which are uniting every department�s goals, organizational strategic goals , and unites them, the information technology projects deals with  achieving  the organizational goals  (Weill, et al., 2018b). 
////////
Enterprise Architecture provides suitable artefacts , frameworks,  tools, and  methods which help this  organization to lower complexity, which is not needed and allows organizational agility, between some benefits. Nevertheless, there are different difficulties  that face the adoption of enterprise architecture. Other challenges include the organizational culture and employees(humans) . The chosen organization for this study  requires to establish if the factors determined by (Gilliland, et al., 2015) and also the ones determined by Spewak in (Kaisler & Armour,  2017) are hindering their EA adoption efforts.



Additionally a survey  was utilized to give an insight into the barriers experienced throughout the adoption of EA. It was selected  to give an insight into the level  to which stakeholders of EA believe that the  efforts of EA can benefit from promotion or introduction of knowledge management activities like giving the important  tools which enable the EA team and other employees to collaborate or  promoting a culture of knowledge sharing . The research utilized a survey to gain the enterprise architecture perspectives of important organizational.

study the target population was the IT personnel working for organization. Every IT personnel working for this organization formed the participant of the research. This research focused on a specific occupational category this means only IT personnel working for organization was used. Quantity of target population: In terms of statistics, it was generally believed that a sample must ideally be more than twenty-five(25). Provided that the population size which will be surveyed in this  research  is one hundred and fourteen(114), a sample size of eighty-five(85) was considered suitable for the motive of the investigation. Reasons for choosing quantity of the target population: As stated by Zikmund in Schilling (2018), a population is �every complete set companies, people,  or the like that are  sharing other sets of characteristics�. The relevance population for this research comprised   all organizational members because the whole organization is either influenced or impacts enterprise architecture .  The target population is every IT personnel working for the organization.

The question was targeted at establishing the viewed Enterprise Architecture impact  to the organization. The EA benefits mentioned on this question were constructed on literature review carried out on Chapter two under section 2.3. Respondents were given 4 response options: don�t know, worse, improved, highly improved as indicated .


Management of Risk �management of risk was also indicated to  benefit from enterprise architecture .

From Figure 4.4.5.1 to Figure 4.4.5.10, samples are identified by utilizing the recommendations to improve adoption of Enterprise Architecture (There is a great  knowledge sharing level of among  other organizational members and the Enterprise Architecture team, Activities of Enterprise Architecture  are producing  the anticipated benefits, and so on ) on a 4 point Linkert scale .  In this case, the  labels are  recommendations to improve adoption of Enterprise Architecture. The value is the  response percentage  from participants. 



Enterprise architecture was indicated facilitating  regulatory compliance, both quality management and general compliance management. Reason being  that  applying enterprise architecture is  improving  the of data accessibility needed  for regulatory compliance.



Improved compliance with regulations 

The spread  of recent regulations and also the growth in requirements of compliance  are challenging specifically  for companies which operate  in the  utilities, insurance, telecommunication, and banking sectors. A compliance management which is efficient relies on organization�s transparency . To implement compliance requirements efficiently in a manner which is agile, it is essential revealing  architectural dependencies.


--
Enterprise Architecture started to evolve as a regulation and currently it is deemed to be  offering company�s  high-ranking  holistic view of the whole  �Business-to-Information Technology� stack covering organizational structure, business processes,  information technology and software  infrastructure

Furthermore, Weill, et al( 2018a) stated that the success organizational changes are outcomes of integrating and identifying each and every  variable of an organization for example systems, people , processes, structure and  culture.


Meanwhile appreciating and understanding the different view of EA is very important, it is vital noting that  Enterprise Architecture is existing primarily  to offer more understanding of an organization, by combining  the surrounding business environment, strategies, goals, the business drivers, via organizational roles ,  business processes, responsibilities and combining  them to the basis of information technology systems which the organization relies on (Centobelli, et al., 2017). Therefore, to summarize it,  the success of  Enterprise Architecture initiatives takes into consideration a broad spectrum of inputs from different  organizational domains. The next subsection is discussing  other important inputs.


Enterprise architecture assists to assure that the legacy processes that fragmented are optimized to an environment which is integrated,

nbnbnbnb
Improvement of  company�s standards and processes  - it was discovered  that enterprise architecture assists companies to  enforce discipline,  improve and standardize business processes.
Furthermore, additional  to enterprise architecture  assisting to determine a company�s   �execution foundation�, enterprise architecture also allows  companies to integrate their process standards as well as reusing  and consolidating their business processes. Additionally , enterprise architecture improves agility, process change, business change and flexibility.

Interview:


Figure 4.2.1 2 graphical representations of data (outcomes vs probabilities )
The 2 graphs indicate probabilities of the different results  when we throw
a pair of dice. On the first probability histogram , we may easily view the
relationship among the different results and their probabilities. Nevertheless , we may not simply view the proportions of the different results simply , meanwhile in the pie graph on the right we can almost immediately see that almost
half of the time, the outcome will be a 6, 7 or 8.
Presenting the results of a study will generally require a mixture of both text and
graphics. It is generally not sufficient to present graphics and expect a reader
to gain the understanding we expect them to immediately. Explanatory text
explicitly stating the intended meaning is required in order to ensure that the
reader has understood the point being made.
Summary
Statistics provide us with a set of accepted methods for analysing sets of data.
The two primary types of analysis allow us to characterise data and to draw
conclusions from that data. Descriptive statistics allow us to develop summaries
and to determine various key characteristics of the data, while inferential
statistics provide us with means of drawing conclusions about populations based
on a sample of data.
Probability is the study of the likelihood of observing various outcomes.
Probabilities are expressed as fractions or decimal amounts, and the sum of all
possible outcomes is always 1.
Inferential statistics attempt to determine whether a particular observed
outcome is the result of randomness (supporting our understanding of existing
knowledge) or whether we have discovered something new, supported by our
gath ered data. The accepted method for making such a discovery is to test
hypotheses using the following four steps:
1. State the hypotheses.
2. Set the decision criteria.
3. Compute the test statistic.
4. Record the decision.
This established method enables us to draw defensible conclusions from a set of
gathered data.

Review the chapter
Answer the questions and complete the tasks to assess whether you understand
the content of this chapter:
1. Why is the use of standardised analysis techniques important when
examining data sets? How do they help to remove bias and how do they
ensure that conclusions are defensible?
2. What is meant by the term �statistically significant�?
3. How can statistics be misapplied or misused and what can be the results
of such abuse?
4. What is the difference between accuracy and precision when gathering
data? How do they influence the data that is gathered?
5. What does the correlation coefficient tell us about the relationship
between two quantities?
6. Consider drawing a card randomly from a standard set of playing cards.
State the probability of drawing:
a) a black card
b) a picture card
c) two pairs
d) a royal flush.
7. How do the probabilities of the outcomes in question 6 change if jokers
are present or absent from the pack?
8. What do the terms �standard� and �normal� refer to in the term �standard
normal distribution�?
9. How do the z-score and the test statistic relate to each other?
10. Review the graphs presented in this chapter and consider whether the
choice of graph is appropriate in each case and whether it complements
the discussion adequately. Would you have presented some of this data
differently?
/////////
Data presentation
By now you have revisited your research problem and question many times
during the process of data analysis and interpretation. In this section, you are once again required to reflect on your research problem and question. Although
you are not recrafting the research question itself, this is your opportunity to
answer it and to indicate how you have achieved your goal and solved your
research problem, by presenting your analysis and interpretation of data. In
your presentation, take a moment to remind your reader exactly what the
problem was, and how you investigated it. Hence, in your presentation of your
data, you are revisiting the main research question with a short preview of how
you endeavoured to answer it.
When presenting qualitative content analysis results, you should strive for a
balance between description and interpretation. Keep in mind that qualitative
research is fundamentally interpretive and that the interpretation represents
your personal and theoretical understanding of the phenomenon under study.
You therefore need to give rich and thick descriptions. You need to organise your
information throughout the presentation in terms of the themes and categories
that you used in your analysis and interpretation.
In many instances, the presentation of your data analysis and interpretation
is done concurrently and alongside the actual analysis and interpretation. For
example, researchers include quotations and highlighted codes in the text of a
research report, dissertation or thesis to illustrate the processes. Although it is
common practice to use typical quotations to justify conclusions, you also may
want to incorporate other options to display your analysis and interpretation,
including matrices and conceptual coding schemes.
Keep in mind that you need to provide a thick description of the analysis and
interpretation. Remember that you are showcasing the evidence of how you
analysed and interpreted your data. Put in the necessary effort to use academic
writing in its finest form.
Accuracy should be an obvious foundation throughout the presentation.
The reader needs to know that the report is trustworthy and worth citing. The
presentation needs to be open and accessible using the data as unwavering truth.
Hence, present the data as accurately and comprehensively as possible by using
rich and thick descriptions.
You can juxtaposition or use contrast to describe your analysis and interpretation
in such a way as to create a compelling story of your journey of research. You are
telling readers your research story, and you need to convince the audience that it
is a true and noteworthy body of research. Qualitative researchers are notorious
for failing to explain new methodologies that they have developed or how they
improvised on an existing method (Chenail, 1995). In order to increase the
trustworthiness of your study it is imperative that you describe the methodcreation
processes in detail.
It is also important to contextualise data analysis and interpretation and
present it in a way that people can relate to. By describing the context and
background of your study, you are grounding your analysis and interpretation.

Research Matters
250
Chenail (1995) suggests using the following presentation strategies:
ll Use a format familiar to your field of study. If, for instance, you are working
in the field of psychology, it might be natural to report data in a sequential
style, as a therapy session concluded.
ll Arrange the findings according to what you identified as being the most
important to the least important, or major to minor � an inverted pyramid.
ll On the other hand, you could use a pyramid format to create a presentation
with a dramatic storyline. This means that you would save the most important
information and findings for last, building up to a climax and revelation.
Finally, it is important to understand that the trustworthiness of the body
of research lies in the way in which the data analysis and interpretation are
presented. The researcher needs to maintain an openness and honesty in
unpacking the analysis and interpretation of data and should provide the reader
with the necessary insight and understanding.
Summary
In this chapter, we discussed the nature of qualitative data analysis and
interpretation, with the purpose of providing a background against which you
can view various techniques. We discussed the iterative nature of analysis and
interpretation and explained how difficult it is to present the two processes
separately.
We also discussed qualitative data analysis and provided an eight-step process
to allow you to conduct qualitative analysis. Coding, and different forms of
coding, was explained and examples were provided.
Several data analysis methods were discussed, including discourse analysis,
conversation analysis, multimodal conversation analysis and semiotics. Lastly,
we discussed how you should go about presenting qualitative data analysis
and interpretation.

4.4 Chapter 4 - Results, Discussion and Interpretation of Findings 
In this chapter you will present your findings, analysis of results, discussion of findings. You need to ensure the following when writing this chapter: 
4.4.1 Presentation 

Use tables or graphs to present findings. 
The tables and graphs must appear in the order that they appear in the research instrument. Ensure that tables or figures are numbered correctly. 
Use percentages to present data. 
You need to make reference to tables or figures when explaining the results obtained. 
All tables and figure must be on the same page. Tables cannot be continued on the next page. 
Explanation of tables and figures must appear directly below the table/figure. Interpretation, justification and discussion follow 
Refer to the guide on Basic introduction to statistics for further assistance on presentation and analysis of findings. 

4.4.2 Interpretation and Discussion 

Your analysis or interpretation must be based on the data that you have collected. You will be required to think hard and carefully, and argue persuasively, your interpretation of results and evaluate their implications for your organization. 
The results from each table or figure must be analysed and discussed in detail. 
Use theory from chapter 2 to justify your findings. 
New theory can be brought in to justify current findings. 
There is no right and wrong answer here. The emphasis is on sound, logical interpretation of the findings, justified by theory. 

4.5 Chapter 5 � Conclusions and Recommendations 
The purpose of chapter 5 is to demonstrate to your examiners that you have done research worthy of a MBA Degree. It is, therefore, part of your dissertation where you tell your reader what you have achieved and point to the places in your dissertation where the evidence of your achievement can be found (Hart, 2005). 
The following must be considered when preparing this chapter: 
This chapter must have an introduction and conclusion. 
Findings must be presented first, thereafter; the conclusions must flow from the findings. 





A number of people who took part , forty four which is 55.7% answered that Enterprise Architecture was improved on the technical integrity; the other twenty two which is 27.85% answered  that they do not know the technical integrity outcome of the Enterprise Architecture. The discoveries  are opposing the documented claims in Chapter two where it was mentioned that improved technical integrity is 1 of the Enterprise Architecture benefits. The feasible reason for such discrepancy may be found in 4.4.3 section  where the barriers to success adoption of Enterprise Architecture were explored. 



https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3ameeting_MDMyZmVkOTQtOWFmZC00MTg1LTgxMWItMzcwOGY0YmQ2MDk2%40thread.v2/0?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%224032514a-830a-4f20-9539-81bbc35b3cd9%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%22fbfa2a52-1a63-4091-9253-ac05bf25ffb4%22%2c%22IsBroadcastMeeting%22%3atrue%7d

Greater than half about fifty three(53%) of the  people who took part  described that audit compliance was improved  as Enterprise Architecture outcome(Table 4.13). 
For statistical analysis, the �Don�t Know� responses were treated as �missing values�.

I have bought $38,650 plus in standard packs today from my accounts and my daily payout for that would be $193.50 a day. That's $70,627 a year plus whatever else I earn from premium packs! The last reset I went through they didn't pay out for 6 days letting everyone exhaust their packs and create pending withdrawals. Then they did 2 rounds of payouts then reset. So I have 2 big level 4 50% withdrawals on each account (all house money) and everything else is going to buy standard packs. The past 2 times I have seen 50% it lasted 9 days and the other 10. This is my theory. Hope I'm right and hope it helps!!!

Just to give eveyone a backgroup
I had a meeting with Jared.Naaido ,yusif and Brenda
in that we agreed that I will investigate why authorization fails when it is done by the robot
but when it done by the user it is not failing 

We did an invstigation
What we picked is that authorization was done before,  it was done by �Ryno eduard swart� on 22 of June
And on the same day the robot tried to authorize it again
the robot was trying to duplicate the authorization

what we need find out from the robot team is where does the get the audit number from

PRICE ALERT
Hi guys, can anyone recommend an app where you can set price alerts. I use bitpanda, but only the desktop version offers price alerts, but they are quite nice to use. You can choose like "alert when price is 10 % down" - but i would like to have one on my phone. Thank you!

4.6 NON-PROBABILITY SAMPLING TECHNIQUES 
Non-probability sampling is any sampling method where some elements of the population have unequal chances of selection (these are sometimes referred to as 'out of coverage'/'under covered'), or where the probability of selection can't be accurately determined. 
It involves the selection of elements based on assumptions regarding the population of interest, which forms the criteria for selection. Hence, because the selection of elements is non-random, non-probability sampling does not allow the estimation of sampling errors. These conditions give rise to exclusion bias, placing limits on how much information a sample can provide about the population. Information about the relationship between sample and population is limited, making it difficult to extrapolate from the sample to the population. 
Consider this example: We visit every household in a given street, and interview the first person to answer the door. In any household with more than one occupant, this is a non-probability sample because some people are more likely to answer the door







This part is discussing the approach which is selected and the reasons for selecting this approach  for providing answer to  the research question. To be specific, the 2 wide social science research categories: qualitative and quantitative  research are going to be covered in the  section. Even in the past years, a 3rd approach called mixed methodology has surfaced. The 3rd approach links the qualitative and quantitative  approaches.

Dear Phillip Mandla,

I came across your LinkedIn profile and Lesedi Software Innovation(Pty)Ltd. I was wondering if you would like to transform any of your business concepts into a simple, credible and engaging short animated video (an explainer video)/Infographics.

The video can be used for the purpose of digital and brand marketing.

Here is the link to some of our work :
http://vidpaq.com/moreinfo/

I was wondering if we can connect and discuss possibilities.

Thanks!
Good Day Team

Failure is the greatest fear in the back of every entrepreneur�s mind, and many times this fear breeds unnecessary levels of caution and start-ups miss the opportunity to accelerate their growth at the appropriate time.



bp I love software because you can build one product and sell it to a lot of different customers

CEOs should do this in the second stage of scaling. But the majority of startups skip that stage on go right on to the third one. This means that the startup keeps growing fast by cutting prices below its costs and spending heavily on marketing to bring in new customers.

However, new entrants such as Discovery Bank, Tyme Bank and Bank Zero are set up to challenge the status quo with innovative servicing and lower-priced banking. The idea of going �greenfield�, at a bank, segment or even product level, is an easy one to dismiss. In the past, banks took years to set up and decades to build up a customer base: but not any more as recent history shows, especially if you are already a bank.

Suggestions (not a question) that might help you write the competition portion of your business plan: 

Hi Mandla, Hope you�re having a good day. I�m a Consultant at Marketing Musts, a global pay-per-performance lead gen. company, and am looking to grow my network in the IT & Services industry. I came across your profile and thought it would be great to discuss mutual business. Regards, Thanga
Carroll 
Suggestions (not a question) that might help you write the competition portion of your business plan: 

  Have you tried the products or services from your largest competitors? If so, think about how your company's product or services compare to the competition as you answer the questions about the competition. 

  In addition, think about what makes your product (or service) weaker than each competitor's product (or service) and how to fix that weakness (or weaknesses). 

  If possible, visit your competitor's website(s) to see what areas they are hiring in (as this could help you understand their future competitive strategy).

  Set up Google Alerts on the competition so you are always aware of competitive news flow.  

  Separately, check out the websites and the annual reports of your competition as they often must disclose their weaknesses in their annual reports (by law). 

  Consider checking out who your competitor's follow on Twitter as this can signal what their current and or future strategy might be (as well as who their larger competitors are).  Also, read the competition's Yelp reviews, Better Business Bureau reviews and Glassdoor.com employee reviews (if applicable).

  Lastly, as you look at the competition's employees, think about what you could offer them in order to have them join your company (i.e., partial ownership, more responsibilities, etc.)

Change agents should be diplomatic in their interactions and require a solid  understanding of some   disciplines in the company , and have the will to ask tough questions and influence policy wherever appropriate. They must also be trustworthy and thick-skinned enough to face criticism and resistance to change. Finally, they should be effective in communicating, practicing, facilitating and training for the organization�s new and improved way of being.

Co-operative Incentive Scheme (CIS)
The Co-operative Incentive Scheme (CIS) is a 90:10 matching cash grant for registered primary co-operatives. A primary co-operative consists of five or more members who are historically disadvantaged individuals.

The objective is to improve the viability and competitiveness of co-operative enterprises by lowering their cost of doing business through an incentive that supports Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment.

Data created is generic

It converts values into columns and puts them as values
Hence they are in square brackets

It goes creates dynamic data for first Deal,
Remember this data is generic, I dont have control over it  

It goes and creates dynamic data for the second deal
It creates a blocks

It does not allow duplicates columne





First explain how dimesion dat for 1 column
Explain how dynamicdata works for second works
It does it automatically
I dont have control for that , it does that automaticalli


dynamicdata takes the value of a record and uses it as column
These values belong to one column name  which is aud_after/CPK Values


Dimentional Data using 2 columns

It is done automatically, I dont have control over it 

these values belong 2 1 column



you cannot have duplicate column names-the data is not unique

It is generic

7.2. Strategy
Strategy is defined as an integrated and co-ordinated set of commitments and actions designed to exploit core competencies and gain competitive advantage. Strategy refers to the way in which all resources are applied in the business to gain advantage over competitors. The resources include finance, human resources and innovation assets, and their application. The principles of strategy are as relevant for the small business venture as for larger organisations. The key differences between small ventures and large organisations relate to resources, growth stage, competitive environment and structure.

It also has a good chance of capturing the majority of its credit card clients (bought back from FNB) and a sizeable slice of its medical aid and insurance clients.

Capitec has more than 10-million customers, who will have been enticed, in part, by the much lower cost of banking. And yet the big four still have 83% of all bank deposits in the country and 92% of all mortgages, which shows how concentrated the market still is.

The Religious world does not like a free thinker. When I use my mind, I do not mean to be offensive. I am only being honest about the very feelings we all have when ae are given the excuses about the stark circumstances that we have been subject to. I grew tired of feeling guilty about realizing the obvious.

Problem-solving skills � successful production support engineers excel at resolving problems encountered by users, whether these require only quick fixes or major collaborative efforts across various departments
Technical expertise � regardless of their industry, all production support engineers have a deep understanding of the product they handle as well as the processes behind it
Customer service � production support engineers must communicate well with customers, paying attention to their concerns and providing clear, regular updates for ongoing requests
Attention to detail � it�s crucial for production support engineers to be mindful of details since their tasks include creating extensive documentation, tracking errors, and making changes to products
Multitasking � production support engineers handle technical issues from multiple customers at the same time, along with other responsibilities such as writing reports and participating in manufacturing or development

A production support person/team is responsible for monitoring the production servers, 
scheduled jobs and task schedular, 
log incident management and receiving incidents and requests from end-users
, analyzing these and either responding to the end user with a solution or

The Production Support team is essential to increasing and maintaining our stability.  Verifying and analysing technical incidents, this objective team will improve turnaround times and reduce handovers.  The Production Support Lead has to be quality and service oriented in order to operate successfully.  Co-located with Application Support, this individual is a leader in the Software Engineering practice but also has an accountability to the Head of Operations in order for us to grow a cohesive and effective operations capability.  Leading a small team of their own and also coordinating seconded resources from each of the technical teams, the Technical Support Lead will drive Operational Excellence for Software Engineering by being accountable for identifying and eliminating repeat work and tracking the quality of our operations.

#ProudSAShotLeftist

In the History of man, no one has ever become rich working for a salary.
Save between 10 and 15% of your gross monthly income for ten years.
If you restrict yourself to working for money you will never become financially independent.
If you are able to pay down your credit cards by R500 per month, then the amount you will have to pay in interest is steadily declining.

The challenge is to learn as much as possible the easy way � by adopting a receptive attitude;  an attitude that searches for answers rather than an attitude that is immediately cynical and negative

So obviously, the first requirement of making your money work for you is to beat inflation by a healthy margin
Successful investors are those who are always humble towards the market; always willing and ready to learn; always prepared to abandon pre-conceptions and think laterally.


This can only be achieved when the income which you receive from your investments exceeds the income that you receive from your work (i.e. your salary). So financial independence is defined as the point where you are earning enough from your investments to live off without the need to work. In other words, the point at which the income from your investments is equal to the income from your salary.




Eliminate the Middlemen

Almost all employed South Africans invest in shares on the JSE without realizing it. They do so through a 'middleman' institution such as an insurance company, unit trust or pension fund. If you find yourself in this position, then you should do some hard thinking about the value that these organisations (especially unit trusts and insurance companies) offer in return for their fees.

The companies listed on the JSE are the primary wealth-generating engine of the economy. If you place a middleman between you and this engine then you will have to pay him a regular fee � and so, at the very least, you should be sure that he is worth paying!


NBNNBNN
Endowment/Investment Insurance

Endowment or investment insurance policies are policies which have as their primary objective investment rather than life cover. These days most endowments are coupled with life cover to �sweeten' the package (and to obscure the true return), but you will usually find that you can obtain the life cover on its own for far less. If the company or broker that you deal with cannot offer this, then find someone else who can.


???????????
You can always do better by buying blue chip shares directly on the JSE and holding them.

I know this is a late reply to Greg, as far as Clickbank goes, I also got a message saying that I couldn�t register with my Gmail account from South Africa. I saw a tip online that recommends that you use a mobile device (I used my phone) to register on their website. I did that and was successful and can now log in using my credentials on my PC. I�m yet to make use of the program though.

Hope this info helps

Investigation or indian guy?



Hi guys awesome article. I recently made over R100k with a small niche affiliate site. Affiliate cash and sale of site. To verify paypal you need to deposit a small amount into your paypal acc. Clickbank registration is easy and gmail works fine. Just ensure your password is as per they format caps numbers and special characters. Trust this helps.

Many of the world�s most dominant brands like amazon, uber, asos, booking.com or alibaba all offer affiliate marketing programmes yet when you look at companies in South Africa or the rest of Africa very few do which is a bit surprising given the many benefits of affiliate marketing. However, as Lico Gross from affiliate network Admarula has said one of the reasons for this is that unti very recently very few bloggers and social


Hi thanks a lot this article is quite spot on. I have started since 2012 in this digital lifestyle and most of the money I made through selling digital products. I have found that affiliate marketing is simple if you have a paypal account. I have been using paypal to pay and receive money. Locally in South Africa we have also http://www.bidorbuy.co.za which offer affiliate marketing opportunities.

After we familiarized ourselves with foreign exchange trading we then developed a trading strategy called �One Minute Strategy�, not only did our strategy work wonders for us, we started selling the strategy at the price of R250 and it went viral within the year of 2017, seeing to that was a lot of traders who were in it for a longer period than we have and most famous traders in the country using the strategy without our knowledge and not so long after realising that we have been ambushed of off our strategy we went back to the drawing board to develop a better version of One Minute turning it into a One Minute Strategy Modifications which saw us doubling our trading accounts into much higher profits. Exactly a year later Mmutlane Traders Pty Ltd stands at a net of over R5 000 000 with an initial trading account of R17 000.

S&P 500 is just 8%.
But even more incredible: If you
followed the stock picks of these
brilliant investors, but waited to buy
them only after they dipped 33%
BELOW what these billionaires paid
for their shares, you could have made
82% a year for the 12-year period.
That�s 82% a year, while the broader
stock market experienced the worst



Moreover, too many investors do not
understand the risk they�re asked to
take to achieve an 8% return.

TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT
*** Friday Shout Out ***

This week�s shout out goes to one of our Professional Swing members Miguel Vieira. Miguel very simply, embodies the TSC ethos of testing, tracking, reviewing and optimising your trading results.
Basically, he is ALL OVER his data. 

Many traders never really know if their strategy or process, and in turn their edge, is sustainable or is changing over time, or could be much better than its current trading parameters and results.
Taking our Swing Reversal Pull Back strategy, Miguel decided to simply take one element and optimise it fully. He decided to keep the target price the same after testing the strategy and knowing that it works well as a 1:1 reward to risk ratio, but doesn�t have the greatest capacity to run on further. He then decided to look at stop manipulation to see if moving the stop closer to the entry and thus improving the risk to reward would improve the results. 

In short it did and by a lot! 

But the key � he is testing so many different reward risk variables that he was able to drill down to the exact best result and how it impacted the win loss ratio. He now has the freedom to choose the risk to reward that matches the win loss ratio he is happy with. 

In mine Martin's, Ceri's and Lewis's humble BUT accurate opinion, this is the work you all need to be willing to take on to not only improve your trading but empower you to actually be more confident as a trader and, as conditions change in the future, be able to track and react by using data not intuition.

Some of you reading this need to not only read but act on it and get our help! 

As we get to the end of the summer and it the last push of the year coming up, many of my live trading room guys and girls have been pushing all summer just like Miguel and now go into the next part of the year with more optimised strategies and with a more empowered and confident mindset. No doubt with even better results to come. 

Great work Miguel!
////////
Bit of Friday Fun - Question for you all

Which of the open positions have no risk on them??
THINK traders mindset when you answer....

Ali Crooks As soon as you move your stop loss closer to the price action you reduce the potential for unit loss but not necessity the overall risk longer term. 
The smart trader plans an executes each trade meticulously but only cares about the results of the trades over a much greater time frame and number of trades placed. 
Moving a stop to breakeven also means that if the breakeven stop is hit, then price turns back and reaches the old target without it reaching the original stop, he or she has yes, had a �no lose trade� in terms of actual cash loss (bar any roll over charges and comms). However, they have also missed out on the potential 2:1, 3:1 (or in Tatie's case 25:1) reward to risk that was originally on the trade that still got hit. 
Think of this example over just six trades��.
Trader 1 moves their stop to breakeven on the first three trades and the stops get hit. Trader 2 keeps the original stop and as a result hits 3:1 winner�s on same first three trades. Trader 2 is now up 9 units profit (non-compounded). Trader 1 is at breakeven. 
Then the next three trades are full losses and both trader 1 and 2 didn�t get the chance to move their stop. Trader 1 is now down 3 units despite being risk free on the first three trades. Trader 2 however is still up 6 units. 
Does that mean you shouldn�t move your stop? Yes, if you are doing because you feel like it. 
But if you are doing it as part of a plan it�s OK, but it�s always good to balance the mindset of relief of a no lose trade, with the reality that this may mean you lose out on the profit that could buffer against further full-size losses. 
SO, in short you should only move your stop if you overall data shows it preferable to your bottom line and it part of your plan. 
AND�� you should continue to record the data going forward to check this process is still preferable to your strategy.


Wow! Im seeing 3 markets where the stop is at breakeven and then just read your answer

Ali Crooks Thanks for posting Chiquita! Like you said this is exactly what we were discussing on Tuesday. 
I think sometimes what stalls people in the learning process with trading, is on some level they have created an emotional / sub conscious link that because they are part of training program we will or it take the pain away. I try and be clear that our job at TSC is to not take the pain, fear, frustration away. But help you as the trader get through it more quickly and effectively and then over time you become better at listening to the positive and negative emotional cues that come along. 
I was talking with Sarah a couple of days back and we were saying that anytime things haven't worked out in our lives it was very often because we swept the negative or niggly feeling we had about something "under the carpet" or used the "too busy" excuse or focussed on something else that made us "feel better" in the short term. 
Your negative emotions are actually your biggest friends and guides if you have the courage to listen to them!

FOR THOSE HAVING TROUBLE MAXIMIZING ON THE SYSTEM (Long post but helpful)

I have been trying a few hacks to understand the system after trying with our group of investors. I always try my best to learn systems to make the best out of the system is (pay attention to capitalized words);

When you first invest irrespective of the amount, when you click GET PAID and receive the message YOU'VE BEEN PAID SEE YOU TOMORROW, make sure you click THE WITHDRAW immediately and withdraw the amount you were paid. Pliiiiiiz make sure you use the EXPRESS WITHDRAWAL to withdraw the amount stated as the express withdrawal. In most cases, it�s always the amount you've been paid for the day. Don't use normal withdrawal it will take you more than 7 days coz all express levels are paid first before normal withdrawals.

When that money gets to your COINBASE, send it back to CRYPTO300CLUB and BUY PREMIUM PACKS. Do this daily without fail. What this does to your investment is; it guarantees that you get paid daily.

Now if you invested the money to make quick cash and run you'll fail. The platform is for long term investors, that's why they say invest what you are willing to lose. It does not mean you lose your money literally, what it simply means you grow your investment without fear and get most out of it. So don't invest your rent money here.

Now how do you get your money back plus 50% profits? Well this is what you do if you are skeptical

Invest $100 buy premium packs based on current 28% daily pay, you will get approximately $25 daily for six days. I always prefer to start on a MONDAY that means it will take me to SUNDAY coz weekends you get half of what you get on weekdays. By REIVESTING $20 BACK TO CRYPTO300CLUB DAILY, this is what you get;

DAY INVEST PACKS GET PAID Coinbase Acc

Monday $100 10pack $25 day1

Tuesday $120 12packs $30 day2 $5

Wednesday $140 14packs $35 day3 $10

Thursday $160 16pack $40day4 $20

Friday $180 18packs $45 day5 $25

Saturday $200 20packs $25 day6 $5

Sunday $200 22packs $35 day7 $15

Balance in Coinbase $80

On Sunday your 10pack bought on Monday expires and you are left with 12packs. By making sure you just invest $20 daily of what you get back to Crypto300 investment you will have your initial $100 investment back in seven days, then use your remaining earning to make more money. If you invest all you get daily by SUNDAY you will have 30packs and we all know what that means. That�s why they insist make the money go round and it will bounce back to you.

Also by investing daily guarantees you daily payment. I tried it and it worked, next Monday I will take the same journey and show you what I mean by investing $100 from Monday to Sunday.

Hope this helps someone who is new or wants a different strategy.

/////////////////
Dear Members

RE: FSCA, TSSB and the change of broker and trading.

July and August 2020 has been interesting months for MTI members. As we grow into an iconic industry leader, we are the centre point of focus from competitors and the media. We thought it imperative to clearly communicate some changes and offer some information with regards to processes that are underway.

Change of broker.

At the end of July 2020, our CEO Johann Steynberg decided to move the MTI Member Pool (11,000 BTC at the time) to a new broker that better suited MTI�s needs. This broker is unregulated, however after careful consideration, MTI decided to move to said broker as it is in the best interests of our members to do so. Dealing with Bitcoin, which in itself is unregulated, made the said broker a better fit for our business model. The claims in the media regarding the relationship between the initial broker and MTI are not true and we trust that this media release clarifies this for you.

We confirm that the previous broker communicated for the first time with MTI on the 7th August 2020 with regards to the freezing of MTI�s account, which account would be frozen until they have received accounting statements from MTI. MTI has had no objection to submitting the said statements to them, however same will, in accordance with MTI�s financial year end, only be available in September 2020. Accordingly, only once they receive said statements, will they release MTI�s Private Funds.

It is important to note that NO member funds are held with this broker and the funds frozen pertain only to MTI�s private funds. Upon publishing this announcement, the LIVE trading account balance for MTI with our new trader is 14235.725BTC.

MTI has taken the decision that the details of its new broker will not be made public. It is our intention to protect our relationship with the broker and we ask that MTI members respect that. The previous broker was inundated with queries and requests from MTI members, which was one of the reasons for the breakdown in relationship between them and MTI.

We confirm and reiterate that MTI was trading the forex market for members on the broker platform since August 2019 and continued to do so without interruption until we moved to our new broker. In this regard, we further confirm that no demo accounts were used, no LIVE trading videos doctored and no member funds were frozen at any point in time.

As you should know, MTI uses MT4 software (MetaTrader4) and trades are effected by our BOT, contracted exclusively to MTI. The result of such trades can be seen in your back office under TRADING BONUS REPORT. From now on, MTI will also have a limited LIVE view of trades taking place on a weekly basis, confirming actual trades and the member pool balance in the back office for the access of all MTI members. This new feature should be LIVE by Friday 21 August 2020.

MTI will not be getting into a media debate with previous brokers, our focus is to deliver a service to our members and maintain our BOT.

� MTI moved to a new, unregulated broker since we are in an unregulated space with Bitcoin

� No member funds are frozen

� MTI has and will continue to offer trading services to our members

� The claims in the media regarding MTI and the previous broker are not true

� Limited LIVE view of trades and pool balance to be added to the back-office Friday 21/08/2020

 

FSCA

MTI have been in discussions with the FSCA in South Africa. Two physical meetings have been attended to by MTI at the FSCA offices in South Africa. All trading proof, balances and processes have been given to the FSCA and upon their request, Johann Steynberg went to their offices and showed them LIVE trading taking place and LIVE trading pool balances.

The future of MTI being regulated by the FSCA was discussed, however, after considerable time spent with the FSCA it has become clear to MTI that they will not guide MTI as to what needs to be done in order to be regulated and FSCA approved. The process in order to regularise with the FSCA was done so that our operations would not be interrupted and was by no means an admission of any wrongdoing. The FSCA will be releasing a statement warning member of the public about MTI. This statement will be published despite the fact that they have seen LIVE trades, confirmed Member Pool Balances and despite the responsibility MTI expressed it feels towards helping members in trying economic times. MTI takes the service we provide to members seriously and we intend on continuing making a difference to members with our innovative product and we stand by our Brand Promise to you. MTI will continue to Grow Your Bitcoin.

� MTI tried to work with the FSCA

� FSCA does not have any intention to assist MTI

� MTI furnished FSCA with all documents requested and showed LIVE trades and balances

� FSCA to release a statement regardless of the above, warning people against MTI

 

TSSB

MTI was issued with a notice from the Texas State Securities Board (�TSSB�). We have every intention of effectively engaging the TSSB and we have connected with an SEC Defence attorney to assist MTI in this process. As this process is in progress, we cannot further comment on the matter but assure our MTI members that this is a priority and we will do whatever it takes to resolve this matter. Having said this, however, we confirm that after discussions with our SEC Defence attorney, as well as further perusal of the TSSB notice, the grounds upon which notice was submitted seem to be of no merit and pertain to members who were not even based in Texas. As such, and although MTI deems it important to be compliant in every way possible, MTI intends on dealing with the TSSB in the appropriate manner.

� MTI is in a process with the TSSB

� US Legal counsel has been appointed

� MTI cannot comment until the matter is resolved

 

Change of Broker and Trade

As a result of the current situation with the FSCA, as mentioned above, MTI has changed from FOREX trading to Crypto�s and we are thoroughly excited about this change.

We have been testing a product in the crypto space for a number of months and the performance of the BOT has been exciting. MTI Management, under the guidance of Johann Steynberg, has decided to move MTI into a pure crypto space. This change will be affected on Friday 21 August 2020.

We are very excited about the change and assure our members that our focus has not and will not change. Our aim is to service our members and to GROW Your Bitcoin. Nothing in the back office will change, daily statements will continue and so will communications around results achieved.

During this break from FOREX trading, MTI will continue to seek a trading licence so as to be as compliant as possible. Once this has been achieved, MTI will retake our position in the FOREX Space. We anticipate that this will take no longer than 4 weeks, after which we will then be ADDING the FOREX trading as an additional BOT for members to benefit from, actively then trading FOREX AND CRYPTO�S. The purpose of this change is to offer more to our members and to ensure that MTI continues to help you Grow Your Bitcoin!

� MTI FOREX trading is on hold

� New, tested Crypto BOT will be going live on Fri 21 August 2020

� FOREX BOT will be reintroduced after some weeks

� MTI will continue to help members grow their bitcoin as we have done for the last 18 months

� MTI can change its model to better suit industry requirements to the benefit of all members and without a break in services.

 

YOUR Decision

MTI is focussed and dedicated to our members. We take our social and economic responsibility to our members seriously. We stand by our brand promise and we will continue to deliver on that promise to the best of our abilities.

As a member you know that MTI functions in a volatile market space with the price of cryptos fluctuating daily. We as a company stand by Bitcoin and we are excited about the future as it remains our belief that Bitcoin IS the future.

It was never the intention of MTI to only ever have one product (FOREX TRADING BOT), and our R & D Department are constantly testing and considering new products and so including Crypto trading into our portfolio was a natural move and one we are excited about.

We will still trade with a low to moderate risk strategy by limiting our exposure, trading with AI rather than individuals, spreading our risk and then of course basic risk management strategies suited to the markets and our product. We remind all members of our excellent track record but also that that is by no means a guarantee of future results.

We want to be clear; MTI will be mentioned in the media. A company with MTI�s stature and growth will attract attention. Members are urged to conduct their own due diligence and to remain focussed on the brand promise of MTI. MTI is here to help you Grow Your Bitcoin, as long as we are providing that service successfully as we have been for the last 18months, there is no need for concern. We urge members to remain focussed as we are, to develop MTI into an iconic heritage brand while navigating through an unregulated space in the cryptocurrency industry.

You, as a member, have the freedom to remain with MTI or to withdraw. The withdrawal and administration service that MTI offers to members is FREE. We are dedicated to the process and we are hopeful in our endeavours to establish MTI has an industry leader, changing the negative perception in the media and continuing to service you, our members.

My Bonus Report


mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm

4.4.2.	Theme two: �Misconception� on understanding leadership styles
The responses provided by respondents they shown some inconsistences in terms of outlining the effective leadership styles. It became clear that this happened due to misconceptions respondents have about leadership styles and even not understanding the leadership concept itself.  This is revealed through the respondents� responses;
�The Autocratic leadership style has delayed day to day operations. There are no proper procedures to follow on the orders that are taken to SCM. It�s hard to work without proper resources.�
The other respondents articulated to the above mentioned perception.
�The democratic leadership style is also effective because even new lecturers are involved in decision making processes and their views and suggestion are needed.�
In rectifying the inconsistences of staff�s opinion on the effective leadership styles at Coastal KZN TVET College calls on to implement transformation leadership style which acts as a strong bridge between the supporters and leaders, to develop clear understanding related with the motivational level, values and interests. Girma, (2016:35) stated that transformational leadership reveals the superior leadership performance. The transformational leadership, according to Girma, (2016:35), occurs when the leaders broaden or uplift the interest of the employees. The transformational leaders are the ones who inspire the employees to look beyond their self-interest. The transformational leaders are effective because of several reasons such as the leaders may be charismatic in terms of inspiring the employees, the transformational leaders may meet the emotional need of the employees or they may stimulate the employees intellectually (Girma, 2016:35). Mokhber, Wan Ismail, and Vakilbashi, (2015:221) found out that the transformational leadership and individual-level supporter performance are positively linked

4.4.2.	Theme three: �Lack of relevancy� for the participants about leadership styles. 
The lack of knowledge on staff of Coastal KZN TVET College to understand the concept of leadership styles has brought the study to dead end in terms of establishing the relevant variables that are being tested. Due, to inconsistences of responses provided by the respondents on leadership styles� understanding of the actual concept has caused the study to be unable to explore the impact of leadership styles on organisational performance at the Coastal KZN TVET College. What is prevalent is the fact that Coastal KZN TVET College staff members need to learn about leadership styles first before this study can be done. Therefore it lacked relevancy to them as KZN TVET College staff because they lacked an understanding on leadership styles. However, the pilot study which was done selected few participants who appeared aware of the leadership style concepts there exist at Coastal KZN TVET College. It is of the same reason that the study had to continue. However, the inconsistences of responses illustrated such as;
�Control of resources, budget of activities, and degradation of buildings and development of staff all are causing negative effect on organisational performance.�
Others are attributing the negative effect on organisational performance on different factors as well.
�Autocratic styles of leadership were the management makes decisions without consulting employees so the employees end up making demonstrations as they feel that their contribution is not needed.�
In relation to the aforementioned theme three 4.3.3. It is clearly, how leaders� behaviour affects their performance. Numerous researchers (Suskie, 2018:16) have realised, though, that many of these leadership behaviours are appropriate at different times. The best leaders are those who can use various behavioural styles, and select the right style for each situation.
 
4.4. The Impact of Leadership styles on Organisational Performance???
4.4.1. Theme Four: �Non-recognition� of the positive impact for the organisation by the staff.
The lack of knowledge by the staff members about the adopted form of leadership style emanate from the fact that staff members at Coastal KZN TVET College they do not understand the concept of leadership as explained previously. This has caused them not being able to recognise the form of leadership style that has been adopted at Coastal KZN TVET College and its impact on organisational performance. The evidence is the statements they uttered such as; 
�Every morning we have a briefing session where the management communicate everything with staff members and most of the things they want is for their own benefits not for us or to the institution.�
The literature verifies that if students or staff members in the case of this study provide relevant outcomes are more probable to improve when leadership sources are distributed throughout the school community and when teachers are empowered in areas of importance to them� (Harris, et al., 2017:207). In order for the institution�s leadership to achieve objectives that will produce positive outcomes for the students, an institution has to conceptualise leadership effects on learning this could even help in informing the staff members as to what leadership style that has been adopted.

4.4.2. Theme Five: �Understanding� of the organisation�s performance practices.
Probable is one area of the study were respondents could respond with clear clarity as to what it meant to the study. Every respondent could understand the area in which he or she was satisfied with in relation to organisation�s performance practices. This is validated through the participants� responses.

�Yes, I�m satisfied with teaching and learning it is going on smoothly because everyone knows exactly what is expected to do.�
The other respondent said;
�Yes, there is a quality system used at the college that helps at assisting all employees to support and provide training that is needed;�
And
�There is a lot of improvement which has been achieved through organisational performance practices.�

The literature verifies that the study also indicates that transformational leadership and performance of teams at organisational level are associated positively. Mokhber, et al., (2015:221) stated that performance is the function of skills, abilities, knowledge and motivation which is directed towards a prescribed behaviour.

4.4.3. Theme Six: �Assumption� was based on staff�s articulation of understanding the impact on organisational performance.
The word �assumption� was used based on the fact that participants or respondents lack an understanding of the concept of leadership styles but still they continue to articulate on whether leadership style strategies are aligned or not to organisational performance operations� systems. The statements they used were as follows; 
�Yes, the strategic planning makes sure that all leadership styles strategies are aligned to the college�s operations systems.�
The other respondent said;
�Not real, the operation systems are not effective as they are supposed to be.�

The other positive response was;
�Yes, the college have equality systems that are aligned to the organisational systems.�
There is a significant impact of the leadership styles on organizational performance the literature verifies the aforementioned responses including the theme. The leadership style influences the culture of the organisation which, results on, influencing the organisational performance. Rizwana, (2013) proved this fact by utilising four factor theory of leadership along with the data collected from 2,662 employees working in 311 organisations. The organizational culture and performance are linked to the type of leadership style (Klein, et al., 2013). 

4.5. Improvements required in TVET colleges
4.5.1. Theme Seven: �Convert the negative stereotype� that is the last resort.
It is a known fact that most students resort to TVET Colleges because of poor results they have attained from matric. As a result they pursue on studying in TVET institutions as they know that these are the only institutions that accept students who have attained low points when compared to universities. The acceptance of such students has negatively affected most TVET Colleges. However, Coastal KZN TVET College is no different than any of the other TVET colleges.  The response statements highlighted by respondents show clearly their feelings about the negative effect that affected Coastal KZN TVET College�s performance.
�Poor results impact the performance of the college.�
Different respondents� respondent in their own personal ways by showing how the low rate of Matriculates negatively affecting Coastal KZN TVET College�s performance.
�It has resulted in more students coming to our campus because they did not quality to go to universities.�
However, another respondent showed a different side with regards to the effects of matriculates at Coastal KZN TVET College in relation to low pass rate of 
Matriculates.
�Matriculates low pass rate have positive impacted students and they are moving to TVET colleges. The enrolment numbers are increasing which increases organisational performance because the institution is able to purchase resources which help in facilitating the institution�s requirements.�
In terms of implementing mediation in ensuring that TVET Colleges deliver in their mandate most of them refer to the Mediated effects models of leadership for learning. The model begins by exploring more multifaceted models of leadership for learning. These models incorporate more clearly the means through which leadership could be conceptualised to impact learning (Hallinger and Heck, 1996; Kleine-Kracht, 1993; Leithwood et al., 2006; in press; Pitner, 1988). Mediated effects models of leadership for learning begin with the supposition that school leaders obtain results by working through other people (Bossert et al., 1982; Bridges, 1967, 1977). The task then becomes to conceptualise how leaders impact people and their environment to achieve improved learning results with students. Mediated effects studies of leadership and learning have conceptualised and studied school leadership, largely that of the principal, in relation to a wide range of mediating school-level variables (Hallinger and Heck, 1996).

4.5.2. Theme Eight: �A need for skilled Lectures� for TVET Colleges in particular 
The findings revealed that most lecturers and teachers have relevant qualifications but the challenge that was constantly prevailing was recruiting relevant individuals who have relevant teaching skills and leadership skills to lecture or teach in the TVET environment. The negative effect of recruiting teachers and lecturers became apparent through the responses the participants gave:
�Vocational skills are very important in the TVET Colleges, hence it is a negative impact recruiting lecturers that don not meet the required skills has constantly affected Coastal KZN TVET College.�

The other respondent said;
�The lack of vocational skills impact negatively in the recruitment in Coastal College, since lecturers do not meet the required standards.�
The aforementioned statements can be rectified in the following way; �student outcomes are more probable to improve when leadership sources are distributed throughout the school community and when teachers are empowered in areas of importance to them� (Harris, et al., 2017:207).  In order for the institution�s leadership to achieve objectives that will produce positive outcomes for the students, an institution has to conceptualise leadership effects on learning.

4.5.3. Theme Nine: �Positive effect� on the availability of students funding. 
The issue of availability of financial aid in TVET Colleges around South Africa has created a positive impact for both the students and the institutions. Most students who come from poor families are now able to go to institutions of high learning. While, on the other side the TVET institutions are able to sustain because students find tuition fees reasonable when compared to university fees. Over and above there is NSFAS which fund the students. The responses of articulate to this;
�The availability of NSFAS (Financial Aid) has a positive impact because students can concentrate on their studies rather than worrying about lack of financial aid for their studies.�
It is only fair that the study can relate transactional leadership as an example that depicts the aforementioned type of leadership. As the literature highlights that the approach accepts that people do things for reward and for no other reason (Aderias, Charleston and Jackson, 2017:315) Therefore, it focuses on designing tasks and reward structures. Whereas this may not be the most attractive leadership strategy in terms of building relationships and developing a highly motivating work environment, it often works, and leaders in most organisations use it on a daily basis to get things done. Similarly leading by example is another highly effective way of influencing the team.

4.5.4. Theme Ten: �Educate� about leadership styles at Coastal KZN TVET College
It became crystal clear that the management of Coastal KZN TVET College need to be taught about leadership. This became evident by the nature of different responses they were providing regarding to leadership styles that exists at Coastal KZN TVET College.
�Training and support must be employed at Coastal KZN TVET College.�
Other respondents stated that;
�Transformational leadership strategy should be employed where staff will be inspired by creating an environmental of intellectual stimulation.�
And
�Mixed leadership style will be employed in Coastal KZN TVET College that will enable the College to make and trace critical decision based on the different situation.�
An understanding of leadership can be traced back to the nineteenth century, whereby a man called Thomas Carlyle used such understanding to identify the talents, skills and characteristics of men who rose to power. Whereas, (Anderson, Griffith and Buckley, 2017:245) states that the trait theory of leadership is founded on the characteristics of many leaders � both successful and unsuccessful � and is utilised to predict leadership effectiveness. This knowledge will help the staff members of Coastal KZN TVET College beyond understanding the concept of leadership but to practice it as well.


4.5.5. Theme Eleven: �Understanding� the concept of Leadership style and its relevancy for TVET Colleges
In order to understand and implement leadership strategies requires that one understands the concept of leadership first then leadership styles. However, with Coastal KZN TVET College bases of leadership are necessary to be understood before leadership styles can be relevantly identified. This is evidently verified through responses such as;
�The democratic style of leadership as everyone feels he/she is part and parcel of everything that happens in the campus and he/she is needed.�
And
�Mixed leadership style as it allows all situations be assessed and an appropriate style be used at a convenient time.�
An understanding of leadership styles must be taught in such a way that should unveil where it emanates from as the literature articulates that leadership styles show how leaders� behaviour affects their performance. Numerous researchers (Suskie, 2018:16) have realised, though, that many of these leadership behaviours are appropriate at different times. The best leaders are those who can use various behavioural styles, and select the right style for each situation.

4.5.6. Theme Twelve: �Education� need to be a primary element to teach Leadership to management and staff of TVET Collages.
In the current study it is evident that since the management and staff members are not acquainted with the concept of leadership. It is only relevant that education be the primary element that will unveil what leadership is, so that leadership styles strategies can be defined. In order for the study to be able to eliminate or control those leadership styles strategies which are negatively impacting the organisation�s performance. It is clear again from the participants� response that education is needed on leadership styles.
�Engagement with college stakeholders in different levels on the strategies to control or eliminate.�
The lack of staff member�s understanding of Coastal KZN College leadership style strategies have caused the management to be unable to understand which leadership styles that can be eliminated or controlled. One of the participants alluded to this by saying;
�Sometimes I feel like a blind is leading the blind here, because we are leaders which hardly go for training to enhance our skills.�
The literature highlighted that student outcomes are more probable to improve when leadership sources are distributed throughout the school community and when teachers are empowered in areas of importance to them� (Harris, et al., 2017:207).  In order for the institution�s leadership to achieve objectives that will produce positive outcomes for the students, an institution has to conceptualise leadership effects on learning.

4.6. Conclusion
This chapter provided the findings of the study and interpretation including discussion to those findings. The literature was also used to validate the findings. The essence of the study brought into light many factors which overlooked before the study started. This included specific variables which were supposed to be picked up during the pilot study. However, those variables will be unveiled in the next chapter which will be discussing the recommendations and conclusion of the study.

Figure 4.4.1.1 is used in addressing the research objective one which states to identify the current role of EA in the asset finance and motor vehicle industry, question one of the survey was used to determine this objective, the question states which phrase describes your identification of EA in the organization. Minimum respondents 5.88% said �I know what Enterprise Architecture  does and I believe it is important�.  Interestingly, this response count  is identical to the response by another 5.88% respondents who rhetorically  reported that  �I did not know Enterprise Architecture exists�. These responses are contra to the findings by maximum 72.94% respondents  who purported that �I know what Enterprise Architecture  does and I believe it is important�.  This inconsistency could stem from the fact that minimum respondents  may have not been taking the important roles played  Enterprise Architecture into consideration. The researcher has observed that the literature has attested that meanwhile appreciating and understanding the different view of EA is very important, it is vital noting that  enterprise architecture is existing primarily  to offer more understanding of an organization, by combining  the surrounding business environment, strategies, goals, the business drivers via organizational roles ,  business processes, responsibilities and combining  them to the basis of information technology systems which the organization relies on, although, of late, and as confirmed by this research, Enterprise Architecture plays an important role  in the asset finance and motor vehicle industry.
//// Minimum value of the figure is 23.81%  the graph indicates that smallest number of respondents chose �To control cost�. Maximum value of the figure is 72.62% ,the graph indicates that majority which largest number of respondents chose  �To  standardize,integrate or/and  remove duplication of related  systems and processes� . The variable that was being tested is in which areas are you expecting to identify the benefits from utilizing EA? this question is linked to the first research objective which is  to identify the current role of EA in the asset finance and motor vehicle industry. Therefore it can be deduced that the important role played by  EA in the company under study is to  standardize, integrate or/and  remove duplication of related  systems and processes. These finding were verified by literature review on chapter 2 which states that improvement of  company�s standards and processes  - it was discovered  that enterprise architecture assists companies to  enforce discipline,  improve and standardize business processes. Furthermore, additional  to enterprise architecture ,this is assisting to determine  company�s   �execution foundation�, enterprise architecture also allows  companies to integrate their process standards as well as reusing  and consolidating their business processes. Additionally , enterprise architecture improves agility, process change, business change and flexibility. 
i)	Discuss the minimum and maximum values of the figure and then state their significance to the representation to the graph itself.  DDDD
The research findings  reported that majority respondents (72.94%)  , followed by managers (15.3%) and minority CIO(1.2%).
ii)	 Then, deduce interpretation based on the variable that was being tested. Remember it is graphical representation that needs to be discussed and interpreted not tables.
iii)	 If the findings need to be verified by the literature review abstract that portion from the literature review on chapter two.
iv)	 Ensure that all the above-mentioned points must be presented in a paragraph format below your graph.
v)	 Ensure that each graph, table, interpretation and discussion of the findings must be in the same page.

Kindly revise your interpretation of the findings including your discussion throughout chapter four.

I have started to invest in Index Tracker with my tax free account. I am very excited! I have question about the Retirement account (or pension funds); In France, you have the option of income tax deductible when you make a deposit on your retirement funds and in several years later at the retirement when we make withdrawals you �ll pay your income tax. What do you suggest? To deduce our income tax now and pay it at the retirement or pay all the income tax now and pay no tax at the retirement what do you think? I think the best way is to pay all the income tax now when we are active, and then at the retirement, no tax on withdrawal. It is when we are retired that we will need the most money I guess.

@ Ann: in the last session you referred to a module where we can find information of how to handle your private investments vs your business: e.g. paying yourself out. I couldn't find it. Where should I look to find it?

Shoprite billing errors started since Miles go live, 
but business is only picking some of these issues now
a shoprite deal has doubled investment value 
because it was using a wrong version which is version4 instead of version 2,
yesterday business fixed the version on prod,
this means that the customer is paying more than what is expected 
to fix the issue we have to run 2 jobs month to month 
and the job names are CalculateRevisionFormula and CreateBillingItem

On these jobs we pass 2 parameters which is deal id and the date
the issue started in July 2022 so we have to backdate it and
manually run the jobs month to month until June 2023,
according to business this has to go in before year end,


We have fixed the issue similar to this one before on production, 
We received a sign off from business
to prevent this issue from happening business must be able to identify number of errors on billing ,
pran is busy with the selection

Hi @ I believe the cut off date for UAT is the 12th of October
it is best to include Sandy and this discussion because she works closely with business and gets sign off them
As far as I am aware the only ticket that is outstanding is from the BAU list is FML-4739 or FML-4842
https://firstrandgroup.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/WSBCorporate/CorporatePMOIP/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BEC73EE0F-7500-47F1-BE83-6156D827729B%7D&file=Miles%20Monthly%20QA%20&%20UAT%20Testing_2023.xlsx=&action=default&mobileredirect=true

Themba Sivate is the one who normally presents BAU tickets at ecab, I am not sure how many tickets were presented at ecab this morning  


According to Sandy 

Hi Govender, Candice, the system has now stabilized. Issue was with unterminated db connections due to users actions requesting resources multiple times within a fraction of time waited. E.g. clicking a db linked button and not having patience to wait even 3 seconds.

 

This result in too many active db connections that end up causing traffic and make the system slow.

 

An urgent meeting was called and business was requested to advise users to minimise and exercise a little patience when system is loading.


Hi Siphahlanga, Melathi, this example was to narrate the activity that result to the multiple db connections for a single user action. Yes, a click of a button can trigger processes in the backend that interact with a database hence I said they are requesting resources not searching.

I removed this one from the list FML-5340, we cannot get hold of the user she is on leave , we need to clarify her requirements 


FML-5010 Unable to open work order on vehicle - CY289048
Good day @Mtombeni, Mandla,
Please see below as requested.
Please advise on the business impact or motivation – This is a FML Fleet vehicle which requires maintenance and repairs. Without being able to process Work Orders and Transport Orders and issue approvals to suppliers, we cannot have the vehicle repaired. This causes downtime as well as a very unsatisfied client.
on why should it be allowed to go in? Same as Above
or why it cannot wait? Same as Above
