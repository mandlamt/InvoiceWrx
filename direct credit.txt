22 - Direct credit payment - Post  

Step 5: Verify with Oracle that the Export file has been processed successfully   
Step 6: If the file is successful - Import the PVR  
Step 7: Check the HTML logfile to see if the Import is successful or rejected (new step)

Step 8: The ACB Payment Batch Status must be communicated to the EBS team and Business on a daily basis

NB: In the event where the Miles ACB Payment Batch was reversed on Miles an Emergency War Room Session must be called to discuss the implications thereof.
We must receive confirmation in writing from Finance and EBS before proceed with ACB Payment Batch Processing after an ACB Payment Batch was reversed on Miles.
